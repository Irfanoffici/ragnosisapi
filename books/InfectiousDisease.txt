PREFACE
The 2004 Pocket Book of Infectious Disease Therapy is intended for
physicians and other care providers who manage adult patients with
infectious diseases. These include internists, generalists, surgeons,
obstetricians, gynecologists, medical sub-specialists, and surgical
subspecialists.
This book has the same lofty goals as the first eleven editions: to provide
standards of care for the management of infectious disease with particular
emphasis on antimicrobial agents, their selection, dosing regimens, costs,
and side effects. As with prior editions, there is extensive use of
recommendations from various authoritative sources such as the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Medical Letter on Drugs
and Therapeutics and from official statements of learned societies such as
the American College of Physicians/American Society of Internal Medicine
(ACP/ASIM), the American Heart Association (AHA), the American Thoracic
Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the
Surgical Infection Society (SIS).
The 2004 edition has extensive additions, deletions, and revisions. Tabular
material has been updated to account for recently approved antibiotics and
new recommendations for management. This edition includes topical issues
such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile Virus,
hepatitis C virus (HCV), and bioterrorism. It also contains the new
guidelines for intraabdominal sepsis, IV catheter-associated sepsis, fever
of unknown origin, fever in the neutropenic cancer patient, and HCV
management. Antimicrobials introduced since the tenth edition that are
now included are peginterform, valganciclovir, adefovir, caspofungin,
voriconazole, cefditoren, ertapenem, and nitazoxanide.
The HIV/AIDS section has been deleted because of space constraints and
the availability of an alternative resource: Medical Management of HIV
Infection by this author.
The reader is encouraged to notify the author (1830 Monument Street,
Room 437, Baltimore, MD 21205, 410-955-7634) if there are errors,

differences of opinion, or suggested additions.
The reader is also encouraged to visit the Johns Hopkins website for
updated information. For material related to HIV/AIDS:
http://www.hopkins-aids.edu; for maaterial related to general infectious
diseases: http://www.hopkins-id.edu. Use for management guidance

used for urinary tract infections. With regard to spectrum:P. aeruginosa—ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin;Mycobacterium—ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, or ofloxacin;C. trachomatis—ofloxacin; S. pneumoniae—levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or moxifloxacin;
anaerobes—gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are most active; ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are least active; side-effects: trovafloxacin has a
FDA-mandated black box warning about hepatotoxicity and revised indications in 1999 that restrict use to infections for which alternative
antibiotics are unavailable.
7 . Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor. Amoxicillin + clavulanate (Augmentin), ticarcillin + clavulanate (Timentin), ampicillin + sulbactam
(Unasyn), and piperacillin + tazobactam (Zosyn).
8 .Macrolides: Erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, dirithromycin.
* Oral cephalosporins; cefuroxime has both oral and parenteral formulations.

Antimicrobial Dosing Regimens in Renal Failure
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1. Initial dose is not modified in renal failure.
2. Initial dose is not modified in renal failure.
3. Adjustments in subsequent doses for renally excreted drugs may be accomplished by a) giving the usual maintenance dose at extended intervals, usually
three half-lives (extended interval method); b) giving reduced doses at the usual intervals (dose reduction method); or c) a combination of each.

Female: Above value × 0.85
Pitfalls and notations with calculations follow.
a. Elderly patient: Serum creatinine may be deceptively low (with danger of overdosing) because of reduced muscle mass.
b. Pregnancy, ascites, and other causes of volume expansion: GFR may be increased (with danger of underdosing) in third trimester of pregnancy
and patients with normal renal function who receive massive parenteral fluids.
c. Obese patients: Use lean body weight.
d. Renal failure: Formulas assume stable renal function; for patients with anuria or oliguria assume creatine clearance (CCr) of 5–8 mL/min.

a

Doses for gentamicin and tobramycin should be written in multiples of 5 mg; doses of amikacin and kanamycin should be written in multiples of 25
mg.

b

Seriously ill patients with sepsis often need higher loading doses to achieve rapid therapeutic levels despite third spacing, e.g., 3 mg/kg for
gentamicin and tobramycin.

c

Obese patients: use calculated lean body weight plus 40% of excess fat.

d

Patients who are oliguric or anuric: use CCr of 5–8 mL/min.

2. MAYO CLINIC GUIDELINES (Mayo Clin Proc 47:519, 1999)
a. Initial dose: Gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin: 1.5–2 mg/kg; amikacin: 7.5–15 mg/kg. This is based on ideal body weight (IBW) calculated for males:
50 kg × 2.3 kg (height in inches–60 inches), and for female patients: 45 kg × 2.3 kg (height in inches–60 inches). For obese patients (>30% above
ideal body
P.40
weight) calculate dosing weight is IBW × 0.4 (actual weight in kg -IBW).
b. Maintenance dose: Cockcroft-Gault equation.
3. MONITORING: Measure peak levels at 1 hr after start of 20- to 30-min infusion. Goal with q8h dosing is 5–10 Cg/mL for gentamicin and tobramycin or
20–40 Cg/mL for amikacin; peak levels when using low doses of gentamicin or tobramycin for synergy vs staph, strep or enterococcus is 3 Cg/mL. Monitor
for nephrotoxicity with serum creatinine qd or qod. Monitor for ototoxicity when feasible in patients treated >3 days with periodic Romberg's sign
and with reading an eye chart after rapid head movements.
ONCE DAILY AMINOGLYCOSIDES
Rationale: see Infect Dis Clin Pract 5:12, 1996; AAC 39:650, 1995; Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 14:1029, 1995; Ann Intern Med 124:717, 1996
Clinical trials: 24 published trials (Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 14:1029, 1995): Showed comparable results with once daily versus multiple daily doses
for therapeutic response and toxicity.
Contraindication: Patients receiving aminoglycosides for synergy with beta-lactam agents for streptococcal endocarditis or enterococcal infections should
receive standard thrice daily dosing regimens.
Monitoring: Some authorities suggest monitoring predose levels (18 hr) after second dose, which should show gentamicin or tobramycin levels 0.6–2.0
Cg/mL and amikacin levels 2.5–5.0 Cg/mL; higher levels should lead to dose reduction. All patients receiving aminoglycosides should be monitored for
nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity (see above).
Regimen
1. Standard dose
Gentamicin and tobramycin: 5–6 mg/kg/d (some use 4–7 mg/kg/d)
Amikacin and streptomycin: 15–20 mg/kg/d
2. Dose adjustment based on trough levels
Gentamicin and tobramycin:I0.5 Cg/mL
Amikacin:<5 Cg/mL
3. Dose adjustment based on renal function (Mayo Clin Proc 1999;47:519.)

Use of Antimicrobial Agents in Hepatic Disease
Many antimicrobial agents are metabolized by the liver and/or excreted via the biliary tract.
Nevertheless, few require dose modifications in hepatic disease; with few exceptions, doses are usually
modified only if there is concurrent renal failure and/or the liver disease is either acute or is associated
with severe hepatic failure as indicated by ascites or jaundice. The following recommendations are
adapted from Drug Information for the Health Care Professional, USP DI, 21 st Edition, 2001.
Agent: Recommended Dose Modification
Aztreonam: Some recommend a dose reduction of 20–25%.
Caspofungin: Usual maintenance dose of 50 mg/d is reduced to 35 mg/d with moderate hepatic
disease; no data for severe hepatic disease.
Cefoperazone: Maximum dose is 4 g/d; if higher, monitor levels; with coexisting renal impairment
maximum dose is 1–2 g/d.
Ceftriaxone: Maximum daily dose of 2 g with severe hepatic and renal impairment.
Chloramphenicol: Use with caution with renal and/or hepatic failure; monitor serum levels to
achieve levels of 5–20 :g/mL.
Clindamycin: Dose reduction recommended only for severe hepatic failure.
Daptomycin: No dose adjustment.
Fluoroquinolones: Use standard dose except with trovafloxacin (see below).

Isoniazid: Use with caution and monitor hepatic function for mild-moderate hepatic disease; acute
liver disease or history of INH-associated hepatic injury is contraindication to INH.
Itraconazole: Two-fold increase in half-life with cirrhosis; give with caution.
Linezolid: No dose adjustment.
Metronidazole: Modify dose for severe hepatic failure, although specific guidelines are not
provided; peak serum levels with 500 mg doses are 10–20 :g/mL.
Mezlocillin: Reduce dose by 50% or double the dosing interval.
Nafcillin: Metabolized by liver and largely eliminated in bile; nevertheless, dose modifications are
suggested only for combined hepatic and renal failure.
Penicillin G.: Dose reduction for hepatic failure only when accompanied by renal failure.
Ribavirin: AUC is unchanged wih severe hepatic failure.
Rifampin: Induces hepatic enzymes responsible for inactivating methadone, cortico steroids, oral
anti-diabetic agents, digitalis, quinidine, cyclosporine, oral anticoagulants, estrogens, oral
contraceptives, and chloramphenicol. Concurrent use of these drugs with rifampin and use in
patients with prior liver disease require careful review.
Rimantadine: Severe hepatitis disease use 100 mg/d (half dose).
Telithromycin: No dose adjustment.
Ticarcillin: For patients with hepatic dysfunction and creatinine clearance <10 mL/min, give 2 g/d
IV in one or two doses.
Ticarcillin/clavulanate: For patients with hepatic dysfunction and creatinine clearance <10 mL/min
give usual loading dose (3.1 g) followed by 2 g once daily.
Trovafloxacin: For hepatic failure, adjust by indicated dose—indicated dose 300 mg/d IV, use 200
mg/d; indicated dose 200 mg/d IV or po, use 100 mg/d; indicated dose 100 mg/d, use 100 mg/d.
Voriconazole: Mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency—6 mg/kg IV q12h × 2, then 2 mg/kg IV q12h.

* Anaphylaxis is defined as an immediate systemic reaction due to IgE. Anaphylactoid reactions mimic anaphylaxis but are not caused by IgE.

2. Cross Reactions Among Beta-lactam Agents (J Allergy Clin Immunol 1998; 101:S465. )
Allergy to one penicillin indicates allergy to all.
Allergy to penicillins may indicate allergy to cephalosporins and carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, etc.); it is generally considered safe to
give cephalo sporins to patients with non–IgE-mediated reactions to penicillins such as maculopapular rashes. The risk of an allergic reaction to a
cephalosporin in a patient with penicillin allergy is >10%; it is greater with first generation cephalosporins than second or third generation
agents. Penicillin skin testing is a valid method to test safety of cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients.
There are rare cross reactions with aztreonam.
Ampicillin and amoxicillin cause morbilliform rashes in 5–13% of patients; these do not constitute a reaction meriting skin testing unless the
reaction is urticarial or anaphylactic.
Serum sickness to cefaclor is caused by a hereditary defect in metabolism and does not indicate risk with other beta-lactams ( Immunol Allergy
Clin N. Am 1998; 189:745. ).
3. Skin Testing
This is considered a safe, rapid, and effective method to exclude an IgE-mediated response with O 97% assurance ( MMWR 1993;42(RR-14):45.).
a. The indication is a patient who has a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin or a cephalosporin and who needs penicillin. Morbilliform
rashes to amoxi cillin or ampicillin do not count as a positive history. The test may be used for the penicillin allergic patient who requires a
cephalosporin as well.
b. Patients with a history of severe reactions during the past year should be tested in a monitored setting in which treatment for anaphylaxis
is possible. Antigens should be diluted 100-fold.
c. Patients with a history of penicillin allergy and a negative skin test should receive penicillin 250 mg po and be observed for 1 hr before
treatment with therapeutic doses.
Those with a positive skin test should be desensitized.

P.76
d. Penicillin allergy skin testing : Patient should not have taken anti histamines in the previous 48 hr.
1. Reagents (Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 1999;83:665. ; MMWR 2002;51: RR-6.)
Major determinants:
Benzylpenicilloyl-polylysine (Pre-Pen, Kremers-Urban, Milwaukee, WI) as conjugated of benzylpenicillin with poly-L-lysine in concen
tration of 6 × 10 -5 mEq penicilloyl moieties.
Benzyl penicilloyl (10 -2 or 6000 units/mL).
Minor determinants:
Freshly diluted aqueous penicillin G.
Positive control (histamine 1 mg/mL).
Negative control (buffered saline solution).
Dilute the antigens 100-fold for preliminary testing if there has been an immediate generalized reaction within the past year.
2. Procedure
Epicutaneous (scratch or prick) test : apply one drop of material to volar forearm and pierce epidermis with a 26-gauge needle without
drawing blood; observe for 20 min. A wheal of O4 mm is a positive test. If there is no wheal O4 mm or systemic reaction, proceed to
intradermal test. With a positive scratch test, the subsequent intradermal test should be performed with the corresponding reagent
diluted 10 2 –10 4 fold.
Intradermal test : Inject 0.02 mL intradermally raising a 2- to 3-mm wheal using a 27-gauge short-bevelled needle; observe for 20 min.
A wheal of 2 mm larger than original wheal is positive.
3. Interpretation
For test to be interpretable, negative (saline) control must elicit no reaction, and positive (histamine) control must elicit a positive reaction.
Positive test : A wheal >2 mm in mean diameter to any penicillin reagent; erythema must be present. A positive history and a positive
skin test gives a 50% chance of an immediate reaction if penicillin is given ( J Allergy Clin Immunol 1998;101:S465. )
Negative test: Wheals at site of penicillin reagents are equivalent to negative control. A negative test to major and minor determinants
gives a 97–99% probability of no immediate reaction if penicillin is given ( J Allergy Clin Immunol 1998;101:S465. )
Indeterminate: All other results.

f. Experience with cephalosporins

Literature review of 15,987 patients who received first or second generation cephalosporins showed reactions in 8.1% with a history of
penicillin reaction versus 1.9% without this history ( Arch Intern Med 1992;152:930. ).
A review of 9388 patients with a history of penicillin allergy showed 2 cases of anaphylaxis (0.02%) with cephalosporin treatment.
The rate of cephalosporin reactions with a positive penicillin skin test is 6/135 (4.4%) compared to 2/351 (0.6%) in those with a negative
skin test (NEJM 2001;345:804.).
Patients with an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin should not receive the same agent again, but other cephalosporins with different side
chains may not cause cross reactions. Animal studies suggest side-chain specific antibodies may dominate the immune response to cephalo
sporins (Biochem 1971;123:183. ; Ann Intern Med 1987;107:204. ).
4. Testing without Minor Determinant
If the full battery of skin test reagents is unavailable (minor determinant is difficult to obtain), testing should be performed with major determinant
(Pre-Pen, Taylor Pharmaceutical Co, Decatur, IL) and penicillin G (benzylpenicillin G 6000 units/mL). This testing detects 90–97% of allergic patients;
because lack of minor determinants misses 3–10% of allergic patients, caution is necessary. Patients at high risk of anaphylaxis (history of
penicillin-induced anaphylaxis, urticaria, asthma etc should be tested with a 100-fold dilution of test reagents before testing full strength. A 10-fold
dilution is suggested for other types of immediate, generalized reactions within the past year. Test methods are described above using the
epicutaneous (scratch) test followed by the intradermal test.
5. Penicillin Desensitization (MMWR 2002;51:RR-6.)
a. Penicillin desensitization should be performed in a hospital because IgE-mediated reactions can occur, although they are rare.
Desensitization may be done po or IV, although oral administration is often considered safer, simpler, and easier. Desensitization requires about 4
hr, after which the first dose is given.
b. Parenteral desensitization : Give 1 unit penicillin IV, and then double the dose at 15-min intervals or increase the dose 10-fold at 20- to 30-min
intervals.
c. Oral desensitization protocol (NEJM 1985;312:1229.):

Category/vaccine

Comments

AGE

18–24 yr
Td a (0.5 mL IM)

Booster every 10 yr at mid-decades (age 25, 35, 45, etc) or single dose at midlife (age 50) for
those who completed primary series

Measles b
(MMR, 0.5 mL SC × 1
or 2)
Rubella c
(MMR, 0.5 mL SC × 1)

I nfluenza

Meningococcus
0.5 mL SC × 1

Post-high school institutions should require two doses of live measles vaccine (separated by 1 mo);
first dose preferably given before entry

Especially susceptible females; pregnancy now or within 3 mo postvaccination is contraindication
to vaccination

Advocated for young adults at increased risk of exposure (military recruits, students in dorms, etc)

Military—new recruits
Offer to college students—especially freshmen who live in close quarters (JAMA 2001;286:720; CI D
2002;35:1376)

25–64 yr
Td a

Booster every 10 yr

I nfluenza

Optional

Mumps c

As above

Measles b

Persons born after 1957—need positive serology or proof of vaccination

(MMR, 0.5 mL SC × 1)
Rubella c (MMR, 0.5 mL
SC × 1)

Principally females O45 yr of childbearing potential; pregnancy now or within 3 mo after
vaccination is contraindication to vaccination

> 65 yr
Td a

Booster every 10 yr

I nfluenza (0.5 mL I M)

Annually, usually in October–November

Pneumococcal (23
valent, 0.5 mL I M or SC)

Single dose; efficacy for elderly established for preventing invasive pneumococcal infection
(bacteremia and meningitis, but not for preventing pneumonia (NEJM 2003;348:1737; NEJM
2003;348:1747)

PREGNANCY

All pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and rubella
antibody
Live virus vaccines d should be avoided unless specifically indicated. It is preferable to delay
vaccines and toxoids until 2nd or 3rd trimester. I mmune globulins are safe; most vaccines are a
theoretical risk only

Td a (0.5 mL IM)

If not previously vaccinated—dose at 0, 4 wk (preferably second and third trimesters) and 6–12
mo; protection to infant is conferred by placental transfer of maternal antibody

Measles

Risk for premature labor and spontaneous abortion; exposed pregnant women who are susceptible b
should receive immune globulin within 6 days and then MMR post-delivery at least 3 mo after
immune globulin (MMR is contraindicated during pregnancy)

Mumps

No sequelae noted; immune globulin is of no value, and MMR is contraindicated

Rubella

Rubella during first 16 wk carries great risk, e.g., 15–20% rate of neonatal death and 20–50%
incidence of congenital rubella syndrome; history of rubella is unreliable indicator of immunity.
Women exposed during first 20 wk should have rubella serology and if not immune should be
offered abortion. Inadvertent vaccine administration to 300 pregnant women showed no
vaccine-associated malformations

Hepatitis A

Immune globulin preferably within 1 wk of exposure

Hepatitis B

All pregnant women should have prenatal screening for HBsAg; newborn infants of HBsAg carriers
should receive HBI G and HBV vaccine; pregnant women who are HBsAg negative and at high risk
should receive HBV vaccine

I nactivated polio vaccine
(0.5 mL po)

Advised if exposure is imminent in women who completed the primary series more than 10 yr ago.
Unimmunized women should receive two doses separated by 1–2 mo; unimmunized women at high
risk who need immediate protection should receive oral live polio vaccine

I nfluenza

Pneumococcal vaccine

Not routinely recommended, but can be given if there are other indications

Varicella (VZIG, 125

Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may prevent or modify maternal infection

units/10 kg I M; maximum
625 units)

TRAVEL a

For travelers to developed countries (Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand) the risk of
developing vaccine-preventable disease is no greater than for those traveling in the U.S.
Each country has its own vaccine requirements

(recommendations of Med
Lett 1999;41:39; CDC
Health I nformation for
I nternational Travel
1999–2000)

Yellow fever (0.5 mL SC)
(see MMWR 1990;
39(RR6))

Smallpox vaccination is no longer required and should not be given

Recommended and usually required for endemic area: Tropical South America and most of Africa
between 15° North and 15° South. Give 10 days before travel; booster every 10 yr
Available only at sites designated by local or state health departments
Some African countries require certification of vaccination by all incoming travelers; some
countries in Africa, South America, or Asia require certification of vaccination by travelers traveling
from or through endemic areas
Contraindications: Age <4 mo and hypersensitivity to eggs. Relative contraindications are
pregnancy, age 4–9 months and immunosuppression (HIV, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized
malignancy, cancer chemotherapy, chronic steroid use)
ACI P reported 7 cases of multiple organ failure in recipients of 17D derived yellow fever vaccine;
all became ill within 2–5 days of vaccination and six died (MMWR 2001;50:643)

(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/yellowfever/index.htm ).

Cholera

Typhoid fever

Not recommended because risk is low and vaccine has limited effectiveness (Lancet 1990;1:270)

Recommended for travel to rural areas of countries where typhoid fever is endemic or any area of
an outbreak, primarily travelers outside the usual tourist routes in Latin America, Asia, and Africa
Live oral vaccine—Vivotif (1 cap every other day × 4 starting at least 2 wk before travel)—is
preferred over the parenteral killed bacterial vaccine because of comparable efficacy, longer
protection, and better tolerance (Lancet 1990;336:891); available from Berna Prod
(800-533-5899). New polysaccharide vaccine (Typhim Vi, Connaught 800-822-2463) is also
effective and requires only one IM dose (J I nfect Dis 1992;25:63; MMWR 1994;43(RR-14); Clin
Infect Dis 1995;4:186)

Hepatitis A

Susceptibility may be determined with tests for I gG antibody that are widely available (Lancet
1988;1:1447)
Vaccine (Havrix, SmithKline Beecham; VAQTA, Merck) is recommended for travel outside U.S.,
Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. Protective. Consult CDC advisory
(NEJM 1992;327:453; JAMA 1994;271:1328; Ann I ntern Med 1996;124:35)
Protective levels of antibody are usually achieved 2–4 wk after a single dose. A booster is
recommended at 6–12 mo, but a single dose is considered adequate protection if given at least 2–4
wk before travel. Twinrix requires two doses separated by 1 month prior to travel, otherwise the
monovalent vaccine is preferred. Alternative is immune globulin (0.02 mL/kg IM) available from
800-843-7477. This has established efficacy and is sometimes required for patients who need
immediate protection

Hepatitis B (1 mL I M ×
3)

HBV vaccine if travel to endemic areas, and there is risk of need for medical or dental care, travel
>6 mo, sexual contact with local persons is likely, or if contact with blood is likely. Major risk
areas are China, Korea, all of Africa, Middle East, Southern and Pacific I slands, Amazon region of
South America, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Southeast Asia (Med Letter 2001;43:67). (All of
these are high risk areas for HAV as well)
Accelerated schedule is dosing at 0, 1, and 2 mo with a fourth dose at 12 mo
Twinrix is available for patients at risk for HAV and HBV

Rabies

Consider human diploid cell rabies vaccine (HDCV), rabies vaccine absorbed (RVA), or purified
chick embryo cell vaccine (PCEC) for travelers with occupational risk and those with extended
travel to endemic area

Japanese encephalitis
(JE-Vax, 1 mL SC × 3 in
2–4 wk)

I nfluenza

Vaccine recommended endemic areas with stays of >1 mo in rural rice-growing areas with
extensive exposure to mosquitoes. Potential problem countries include Bangladesh, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malasia, Myanmar (Burma), Pakistan, China, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore,
eastern Russia, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines (NEJM 1988;319:641)
JE Vax is Formalin-inactivated, purified, mouse-brain-derived vaccine that causes urticaria,
angioedema, or other serious reactions in 0.5% of recipients (MMWR 1993;42(RR-1):12)
Attack rate is low: <10 cases in U.S. travelers over 1985–95

Indicated for persons at risk traveling to Southern Hemisphere April–September or at any time of
year for travelers to tropics or travelers in large tourist groups including cruise ships
Need vaccination R 2 wk before travel

Measles (MMR 0.5 mL SC
× 1)

Susceptible persons b should receive a single dose before travel

Meningococcal vaccine
with serogroups A, C, Y,
and W 135 (0.5 mL SC × 1)

Recommended for travel to areas of epidemics, most frequently sub-Saharan Africa
(December–June)
Saudi Arabia requires certificate of vaccination for pilgrims to Mecca or Medina
Vaccine is single dose and provides protection for 3 yr

Polio

Travelers to developing countries outside the Western Hemishere should receive a primary series
and inactivated polio vaccine if not previously immunized
If protection is needed within 4 wk, single dose elPV or trivalent (live) OPV recommended.
Previously immunized travelers should receive one booster of OPV or elPV

a

Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids adsorbed (for adult use). Primary series is 0.5 mL IM at 0, 4 wk and 6–12 mo; booster doses at
10-yr intervals are single doses of 0.5 mL IM. Adults who have not received at least three doses of Td should complete primary
series. Persons with unknown histories should receive series.
b

Persons are considered immune to measles if there is documentation of receipt of two doses of live measles vaccine after first
birthday, prior physician diagnosis of measles, laboratory evidence of measles immunity, or birth before 1957.

c

Persons are considered immune to mumps if they have a record of adequate vaccination, documented physician diagnosed
disease, or laboratory evidence of immunity. Persons are considered immune to rubella if they have a record of vaccination after
their first birthday or laboratory evidence of immunity. (A physician diagnosis of rubella is considered nonspecific.)

d

Live virus vaccines: measles, rubella, yellow fever, oral polio vaccine.

D. SPECIFIC VACCINES
1. INFLUENZA VACCINE
Recommendations of Advisory Committee on Immunization (MMWR 2003;52:RR-8.).
Preparations: I nactivated egg-grown viruses that may be split (chemically treated to reduce febrile reactions in children) or
whole. The 2003–04 trivalent vaccine contains A/Moscow/10/99 (H3H2), A/New Caledonia/20/90 (H1N1) and B/Hong
Kong/330/2001. Product information available from Connaught 800-822-2463 and, Parke Davis 800-543-2111.
Flu mist: This is the first nasally administered vaccine in the U.S. I t consists of live viruses including two strains of influenza A
and one strain of influenza B. This was FDA approved in June 2003 for use in persons
P.105
5–49 years; a single dose is advocated for persons 9–49 years, persons >50, those with medical conditions that constitute
indications for the vaccine, and persons with immunosuppression should use standard influenza vaccine since FluMist is a live
virus vaccine and has not been tested in high risk populations. The cost is $46/dose.
Administration (older than 12 yr): Whole or split virus vaccine, 0.5 mL × 1 IM in the deltoid muscle, preferably mid-October
to mid-November. Recommendations for the 2003–04 season are for preferential immunization of high risk persons in October to
assure an adequate supply for this group. This includes: Age >50 years, children 6–23 mo., persons 2–49 years with medical
indications, healthcare workers and household contacts of high risk persons. The needle should be R1 inch. Protection begins 2
wk post-vaccination and may last 6 mo, but antibody titers may fall below protective levels within 4 mo in elderly patients.
Effectiveness: At least 70–90% effective in preventing influenza in healthy persons (MMWR 1993;42(RR-5):1., Drugs
1997;54:841.) when there is a good match between the vaccine antigens and the prevalent strain(s) of influenza. This has been
achieved in 12 of the last 13 seasons. In elderly nursing home residents, the vaccine is 30–40% effective in preventing influenza
and up to 80% effective in preventing influenza-related mortality (JAMA 1985;251:1136.). Population-based studies show
influenza vaccinations of persons >65 years are associated with a 20–30% reduction in hospitalization for heart disease and
pneumonia and a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality (NEJM 2003;348:1322.).
Target Group for Influenza Vaccine
Note: This list defines the two categories that should have the highest priority for initial vaccination in the event that supplies are
limited.
Groups at increased risk for influenza-related complications
1. Persons > 50 yrs
2. Residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities housing persons of any age with chronic medical conditions
3. Persons with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular system, including those with asthma
4. Adults and children who required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during the prior year due to chronic metabolic
diseases (diabetes), renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression (including HI V infection)
5. Children and teenagers who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy (risk of Reye's syndrome)

6. Women who will be in the second or third trimester of pregnancy during influenza season
7. Elderly and other high-risk persons embarking on international travel: Tropics—all year; Southern Hemisphere—April–September
P.106
Groups that can transmit influenza to high-risk patients
1. Physicians, nurses, and other personnel who have contact with high-risk patients
2. Employees of nursing homes and chronic care facilities who have contact with patients or residents
3. Employees of assisted living and other residences for persons at high risk
4. Providers of home care to high-risk persons
5. Household family members of high-risk persons
Contraindications
1. Severe allergy to eggs
2. Persons with acute febrile illness (delay until symptoms abate); persons with minor illnesses such as URI s may be vaccinated
3. Pregnancy: There has been no significant excess in the influenza-associated mortality among pregnant women since the 1957–58
pandemic (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1959;78:1172.). Influenza vaccine is not routinely recommended, but pregnancy is not viewed
as a contraindication in women with other high-risk conditions. A study of more than 2000 pregnant women who received
influenza vaccine showed no adverse fetal effects (Int J Epidemiol 1973;2:229.). Some experts prefer to vaccinate in the second
trimester to avoid a coincidental association with spontaneous abortions unless the first trimester corresponds to the influenza
season
Adverse Reactions for Influenza Vaccine
1. Soreness at the vaccination site for up to 2 days in about one-third
2. Fever, malaise, etc—infrequent and most common in those not previously exposed to influenza antigens, e.g., young children.
Reactions begin 6–12 hr postvaccination and persist 1–2 days
3. Allergic reactions—rare and include hives, angioedema, asthma, anaphylaxis; usually allergy to egg protein
4. Guillain-Barré syndrome: 1976–77 influenza vaccine was associated with a statistically significant risk of Guillain-Barré
syndrome. A review of the influenza vaccine for 1992–93 and 1993–94 showed the odds ratio for Guillain-Barré with vaccination
was 1.8; this represents a risk of 1–2 cases/1 million persons vaccinated (MMWR 1998;47(RR–6).; NEJM 1998;339:1797.)

IM, maximum 15 mL), acceptable if given within 6 days. Live measles vaccine should be given
3 mo after I G

Usually MMR (0.5 mL SC). Two doses in adults should include second dose R1 mo after first

b

Single dose of live measles vaccine given at age R1 yr should provide long-lasting immunity in 95%. In some settings a 5%
rate of susceptibility provides enough non-immune persons to sustain an epidemic. Persons vaccinated with killed measles
vaccine (1963–67) are considered unvaccinated.
c

Born before 1957, physician-diagnosed measles or laboratory evidence of immunity (measles-specific antibody). Serologic
studies in health care workers showed 9% of persons born before 1957 were not immune, and 29% of health care workers
who acquired measles (1985–89) were born before 1957. Therefore, vaccine should be offered to those born before 1957 if
there is reason to consider them susceptible.

P.107
3. RABIES PREVENTION
Recommendation of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (MMWR 1999; 48:(RR–1.))
Experience: From 1980 to 1997 there were a total of 36 cases of human rabies in the U.S.—12 from dogs outside the U.S. and
21 from bats. Rabies in wildlife (primarily racoons, skunks, and bats) account for gt;85% of animal rabies in the U.S. The major
animal source in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is dogs. Rabies is now rare in domestic animals in the U.S., although gt;80% of
exposures that qualify for post-exposure rabies prevention treatment are dog and cat contacts (JAMA 2000;284:1001.).
Greatest risk is bats including bat exposure with no clear bite; these account for all five rabies cases acquired in the
U.S. from 1998–2000 (MMWR 2000;49:1111.). A review of 26 cases of bat variant rabies indicated that only two were
associated with known bat bites (CID 2002;35:738.). The revised recommendations are for rabies prophylaxis for a
bat bite, but also for situations where there is a reasonable possibility that a bite has occurred (MMWR 2002;51:828.).

RABIES POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS—UNITED STATES, 1999

4. TETANUS-DIPHTHERIA VACCINE
Recommendations of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (MMWR 1991;40(RR-10).
Vaccine: Inactivated toxoid vaccine tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed (Td) are preferred to tetanus toxoid because most
adults who need tetanus toxoid are susceptible to diphtheria (Mayo Clin Proc 1999;74:381.). The primary series is 0.5 mL I M
doses at 0 time, 1–2 mo, and 6–12 mo. Doses should not be repeated if the schedule is delayed. Booster doses are recommended
at 10-yr intervals.
Cost: Td adsorbed, 0.5 mL—$9.75.
Susceptibility: Antigenic response is good but is reduced in elderly
P.110
patients. Current estimates are that 27% of U.S. persons >70 yr are unprotected against diphtheria and tetanus (NEJM

1995;332:761.)
Adverse reactions: Pain and tenderness at injection site; systemic reactions are rare. The frequency of local reactions
increases with increases in the number of doses given.
Contraindications: Anaphylactic reaction or neurologic reaction to prior Td dosing. Persons with a history of an Arthrus reaction
or fever > 39.4°C should not receive Td more than once every 10 yr. Persons who report reactions to a “tetanus shot” before
1938 probably received equine antitoxin and can receive the current vaccine tetanus prophylaxis.

5. PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, CDC (MMWR 1997;46(RR-8)..
Vaccine: 23 valent polysaccharide vaccine for the S. pneumoniae contains antigens responsible for 87% of bacteremic
pneumococcal disease in the U.S. The 23 types (Danish nomenclature) follow: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F,
14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F. Six serotype (6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F, 23F) account for most antibiotic
resistance and are included in the vaccine. Most adults show a 2 × rise in type-specific antibody at 2–3 wk after vaccination.
Efficacy: Seven systematic reviews of Pneumovax between 1994 and 2002 show no decrease in mortality or in rates of
pneumococcal pneumonia in high risk patients (elderly or immunosuppressed) who are the target of current vaccine policies (see
below) (BMJ 2002;325:292.). A more recent report shows efficacy in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease (primarily
pneumococcal bacteremia), but not pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia (NEJM 2003;348:1747.)
Preparation and cost: Pneumovax (Merck Human Health) — $7.66/ dose.
Recommendations for adults:
1. I mmunocompetent adults at increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications because of chronic illness (e.g.,

cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, alcoholism, cirrhosis, or cerebrospinal fluid
P.111
leaks) or who are R65 yr old. Current recommendations are to review risks for pneumococcal disease at the 50th birthday
because 30–40% have medical conditions that merit vaccine.
2. I mmunocompromised adults at increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications (e.g., splenic dysfunction or
anatomic asplenia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, nephrosis organ transplant
recipients, HIV infection, and other conditions associated with immunosuppression).
3. Persons in special environments or social settings with identified risk of pneumococcal disease (Native Americans, homeless,
etc).
4. Patients with HI V infection should be given vaccine early during disease for adequate antibody response.
Note: 1) Vaccine should be given at least 2 wk before elective splenectomy; 2) vaccine should be given as long as possible
before planned immunosuppressive treatment; 3) hospital discharge is a convenient time for vaccination because two-thirds of
patients with serious pneumococcal infections have been hospitalized within the prior 5 yr; 4) may be given simultaneously with
influenza vaccine (separate injection sites).
Adverse reactions:
1. Pain and erythema at injection site: 50%.
2. Fever, myalgia, severe local reaction: <1%.
3. Anaphylactoid reactions: 5/million; severe reactions: Estimated frequency of anaphylactoid reactions is 5/million. A
meta-analysis of 7531 pneumococcal vaccine recipients in nine trials showed no patients had severe fever or anaphylactic
reactions. There have been no cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Arthrus reactions are more common with revaccination at
<4 yr.
4. Frequency of severe reactions is increased with revaccination <13 mo after primary vaccination; severe reactions are no
more frequent when revaccination occurs >4 yr after primary vaccination.
Revaccination: This is recommended at 5 yr for adults who are immunosuppressed or have asplenia and those who were <65 yr
when first vaccinated. Frequency of local reactions is 3.3× higher with revaccination (JAMA 1999;281:243.).
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar): 7 valent conjugate vaccine with antigens for serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F,
and 23F. These account for 80% of invasive pneumococcal disease in children < 6 yr in the U.S. Use is currently restricted to
pediatrics.

Recommendations of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (MMWR 1996;45(RR-11).; MMWR 1999;48(RR-6).)
P.112
Morbidity in adults: Approximately 5–8% of adults are susceptible; about 75% of adults with a negative history for chickenpox
have antibody indicating prior exposure (JAMA 1991;266:2724.). Chickenpox is more severe in young adults; risks are greatest
in pregnant and immunocompromised hosts (Ann Intern Med 1980;93:414.). About 15% of adults develop herpes zoster. The
rate of zoster in vaccine recipients was 2.6/100,000 person-yr in vaccine recipients compared with 68/100,000 persons-yr in a
general population of persons age <20 yr, but these numbers are not necessarily comparable (MMWR 1999;48(RR-6).)

Vaccine: VARI VAX—live attenuated virus vaccine
Note: Vaccine must be stored frozen at < - 15°C to maintain potency. Once reconstituted it must be used within 30 min
Dose: Adult—0.5 mL SC × 2 separated by 4–8 wk
Cost: $65.40/dose
Efficacy: Seroconversion rate in adults is 78% with one dose; 99% with two doses. Protection at 7–10 yr is 70–90% against
infection and 95% against severe disease. Impact in rates of zoster is unknown. It is speculated that reactivation of the vaccine
strain causes mild disease and boosted immunity (Nature Med 2000;6:451.). There are recent reports of vaccine failure that
are expected to occur more frequently as the period of time from vaccination increases (NEJM 2002;347:1909.). A
concern is the possible confusion with smallpox (NEJM 2002;347:1962.)
Indications: Susceptible adults in rank order are in the following categories (Ann Intern Med 1996;124:35.).
1. Health care workers
2. Susceptible household contacts of immunosuppressed persons
3. Persons living or working in areas where transmission of VZV is likely—teachers of young children, day care employees,
staff members in institutional settings
4. Young adults in closed or semiclosed populations—military personnel, college students, inmates and staff of prisons and
jails
5. Nonpregnant women of childbearing potential
6. I nternational travelers
7. Adolescents or adults living in households with children
Cost effective analysis: Serologic testing in adults and vaccinating seronegatives would be cost effective only for those 20–29
yr. Assumptions were cost of vaccination—$78, cost of serology—$20, cost for outpatient treatment of chickenpox—$80 plus
acyclovir at $124 (Am J Med 2000;108:723.)
Contraindictions:
1. Pregnancy or this possibility within 1 mo
P.113
2. I mmunosuppressed patients
3. Miscellaneous: Active tuberculosis; persons who have received blood products within 6 mo (passive immunity precludes
antibody response); persons with anaphylactic reactions to gelatin or neomycin
Adverse reactions:
Fever >100°F: 10%
Local reaction at injection site: 30% in 0–2 days
Varicella-like rash at injection site: I n 6–20 days reported in 37/100,000 vaccine doses; 3% in clinical trials
Generalized varicella rash: 10% in 7–21 days; this usually consists of <10 lesions fasting R3 days and may be source of

VZV transmission to susceptible contacts
Transmission: Transmission of the vaccine strain is a theoretical risk but is documented in only three cases out of 15 million
vaccine doses distributed; all three were mild (MMWR 1999;48(RR-6).).
Post-exposure prophylaxis: Should be given within 3 days of exposure. Comparative cost and efficacy with other postexposure

Recommendations of Advisory Council on Immunization Practices (MMWR 1996;45(RR-15):1–30.; Ann I ntern Med 1996;124:35.;
NEJM 1997;336:196.; Med Letter 2001;43:67.)
Vaccine: HAVRI X-killed, formalin-inactivated (SmithKline Beecham) and VAQTA (Merck & Co); Twinrix (Glaxo SmithKline) (HBV
+ HAV vaccines)
Dose (adult): 1440 ELI SA units (Havrix) (1 mL) I M × 1 or 2 (separated by R6 mo); 50 units/1.0 mL (VAQT). Twinrix—720 units
HAV vaccine and 20 mcg HBV vaccine/1.0 mL to be given at 0, 1 and 6 mo
Cost: $59.45—1440 units Havrix; $62.94—50 units VAQTA; $92.00/dose—Havrix and HBV vaccine (Twinrix)
Adverse reactions: Local reactions in 20–50%, fever in 4% and rare severe reactions: Anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barré syndrome
and other neurologic syndromes
Efficacy: 80% seroconvert in 15 days; >96% at 30 days, with booster dose—100% respond. Duration of immunity expected to
be at least 10 years
Indications: Travelers to countries with endemic HAV (Note: Unnecessary in northern and western Europe, New Zealand,
Australia, Canada, and Japan. Also note that immune globulin is a less expensive
P.114
alternative for short term protection); gay men; injection drug users; persons with clotting disorders; persons >30 yr with
chronic liver disease (including persons with chronic HCV infection); lab workers handling HAV; persons working with nonhuman
primates. Twinrix is recommended for adults with indications. I ndications for both vaccines, especially travelers
Consideration: Day care workers, food handlers, staff of institutions for institutionally disabled
Hepatitis A: Immune globulin: Available from Michigan Department of Public Health (517-335-8120). May be given with HAV at

separate injection sites.

2001;50(RR-1).
Vaccine preparations
1. Recombivax HB (Merck & Co): Recombinant vaccine produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and available
since July 1986; 10 or 40 Zg HBsAg/m; usual adult dose is three 1-mL doses (10 Zg) at 0, 1, and 6 mo; three 1-mL doses
(40 Zg) for dialysis patients
2. Engerix-B (Glaxo SmithKline): Recombinant vaccine available since 1989; 20 Zg HBsAg/mL; usual adult dose regimen is
three 1-mL doses (20 Zg) at 0, 1, and 6 mo; alternative schedule is four 1-mL doses (20 Zg) at 0, 1, 2, and 12 mo (for
more rapid induction of immunity)
3. Twinrix (Glaxo SmithKline): bivalent vaccine with Havrix (HAV vaccine,
P.115
720 ELI SA units/ml) + Energix-B (20 Zg HBsAg/ml); usual adult regimen is 3 1 mL doses at 0, 1, and 6 mo.
Cost: Recombivax HB @ $57/dose (10 Zg); Engerix-B @ $55/dose (20 Zg); Twinrix @ $92/dose for HAV and HBV)
Adverse reactions: I njection site reactions in up to 20%. Systemic reactions are uncommon; anaphylaxis is rare, but
epinephrine should be available for immediate use. Fever is reported in 1–6% of HBV vaccine recipients. Hypersensitivity to
yeast and to thimerosal are contraindications to HBV vaccine. HBV vaccine appears to play no role in the etiology or relapses of
multiple sclerosis (NEJM 2001;344:319.; NEJM 2001;344:327.)

Pre-exposure vaccination:
1. Regimen. Three IM doses (deltoid) at 0 time, 1 mo, and 6 mo; 0, 2 and 4 mo; or 0, 1, and 4 mo. There must be R4 wk
between dose #1 and #2,R8 wk between dose #2 and #3, and >4 mo between #1 and #3. I f series is delayed, start where
you left off. Usual adult dose is 1 mL (20 Zg Engerix B or 10 Zg Recombivax HB); hemodialysis patients and possibly other
immunocompromised patients should receive 2–4 × the usual adult dose (usually 40 Zg doses of either recombinant vaccine
preparation). HBV deposited into fat rather than muscle results in lower seroconversion rates, so needle length is important.
Needles for all men and for women 60–90 kg should be 2.5 cm, for women >90 kg should be 3.8 cm, and for women <60 kg
should be 1.6 cm (JAMA 1997;277:1709.).
2. Response rate. >95% of young, healthy adults develop adequate antibody response (>10 mI U/mL). Non-response is greater
with age over 40 yr, with certain HLA haplotypes, smoking history, obesity, HI V infection, hemodialysis, and accelerated
schedule (JAMA 1993;270:2935.); response rates are 50–70% in persons with HIV infection; 60–70% with renal failure;
70–80% in diabetics; and 60–70% with chronic liver disease. Age-related response rates show >95% seroconversion rates
in 20-yr-olds, 86% in 40-yr-olds, and 47% in persons >60 yr (Am J Prev Med 1998;15:73.). A meta-analysis of 24 studies
with 11,037 vaccine recipients showed a continuous risk of non-response above 30 years. (CI D 2002;35:1368.). This review
also showed that a booster dose substantially improved the response rate. I f the schedule is interrupted it may be resumed
with good results providing the second and third doses are separated by R2 mo.
3. Post-vaccination serologic testing. Recommended for some persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on this
knowledge (e.g., health care workers, dialysis patients, infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers) and for vaccine recipients
who have decreased response rates: Age >30 yr, renal failure, HI V infection, diabetes, and chronic liver failure. When done,
test at 1–6 mo after last dose. Studies in Taiwan show serologic titer decrease of about 10% per year, but efficacy persists
(JI D 2003;187:134.).
4. Revaccination. Revaccination based on measurements of serologic response is controversial. One point-of-view is that
persons at risk, including health care workers, should have periodic antibody
P.116
measurements with boosters if levels are below 10mlU/mL (Arch I ntern Med 1999;159:1481.). The contrary view from the
ACIP is that antibody levels do not measure immunologic memory and that immunologic protection lasts more than 12 yr
regardless of antibody levels (Clin Microbiol Rev 1999;12:351.; Arch Intern Med 2000;160:3170.). I f done, revaccination of
nonresponders will produce response in 15–25% with one additional dose and in 30–50% with three doses (Ann I ntern Med
1982;97:362.). 13–60% of responders lose detectable antibody within 9 yr. New ACIP recommendations include routine
postvaccination serologic testing for healthcare workers, patients with HIV infection and hemodialysis patients. Response is
defined as HBsAb levels of >10 mI U/mL (MMWR 2001;50:RR-1.) Testing is done at R1 month after the 3rd dose.
5. Prevaccination serologic testing. Testing groups at highest risk is usually cost-effective if the prevalence of HBV markers is
>20% (see table below). Routine testing usually consists of one antibody test: Either anti-HBc or anti-HBs. Anti-HBc fails to
detect persons immune from prior vaccination and anti-HBs (only) will falsely identify HBsAg as susceptible. Average
wholesale price of three-dose vaccine regimen is $165–$213; usual cost of serologic testing for anti-HBs or anti-HBc is
$12–$20.

syndrome with plasma-derived vaccine and no serious side effects with recombinant vaccines. Adverse reactions should be
reported to 800-822-7967.
7. Vaccine efficacy. 80–95% for preventing HBV infection in gay men and virtually 100% if protective antibody response (R10
mIU/mL) is achieved.
P.117
Candidates for pre-exposure vaccination:
All infants and children by the age of 18 yr
Persons with occupational risk
Now defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, these include health care workers and many public
service workers. For persons in health care fields, vaccination should be completed during training before students
encounter blood
Persons with lifestyle risk
Heterosexual persons with multiple partners (more than one partner in the preceding 6 mo) or any sexually transmitted
disease, homosexual and bisexual men, injecting drug users
Special patient groups
Hemophiliac persons
Hemodialysis patients
Environmental risk factors
Household and sexual contacts of HBV carriers, clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled, prison
inmates, immigrants and refugees from areas where HBV is highly endemic, international travelers to HBV endemic areas
who are health care workers, who will reside there more than 6 mo, or who anticipate sexual contact with local persons
Pregnant women (MMWR 1991;40(RR-13)).: Risk of HBV transmission from HBsAg-positive pregnant woman to infant is
10–85% depending on HBeAg status. Perinatal infection has a 90% risk of chronic HBV infection and 25% mortality due to liver
disease—cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Children who do not acquire HBV perinatally are at increased risk for
person-to-person spread during the first 5 yr. Over 90% of these infections can be prevented using active and passive
immunizations. Recommendations follow.
1. All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit
2. I nfants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HBI G (0.5 mL) I M × 1 (preferably within 12 hr of delivery) and HB
vaccine (0.5 mL) I M × 3 (5 Zg Recombivax or 10 Zg Engerix-B) at 0 time (concurrent with HBIG) at 1–2 mo, and at 6 mo.
Test infants for HBsAg and antiHBs at 12–15 mo
3. I nfants of HBsAg-negative mothers and children <11 yr should receive routine vaccination with three doses of Recombivax
(2.5 Zg) or Engerix-B (10 Zg)
Postexposure vaccination: (MMWR 1991;40(RR-13).):
Acute exposure to blood: Occupational exposure

Definition of exposure is percutaneous (needlestick, laceration, or bite) or permucosal (ocular or mucous membrane)
exposure to blood. Recommendations depend on HBsAg status of source and vaccination/vaccine response of exposed
person.
Note: HBIG, when indicated, should be given as soon as possible, and value beyond 7 days post-exposure is unclear.

9. SMALLPOX VACCINATION
Recommendations for Using Smallpox Vaccine in a Pre-Event Vaccination Program: Supplemental Recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) [CDC
MMWR 2003;52:RR-7.]:
Vaccination Method: The bifurcated needle is inserted into the vaccine vial to obtain a small droplet of vaccine which is
delivered with 2–3 punctures (primary vaccination) or 15 punctures (revaccination) with sufficient force to allow a trace of blood
after 15–20 seconds.
Normal Response: Most of the local reaction and significant complications occur at 5–15 days after vaccination, which
corresponds with the time of viral replication and the immune response. Adverse events are much less frequent with
revaccination and are most common in older perons who have not been vaccinated for decades or those with cellular immune
deficiencies. With primary vaccination, the maximal inflammation and induration occurs at 6–8 days with a pustule, ulcer, or
scab. Revaccination in a highly immune person may cause a lesion similar to that seen with a positive Tine test, and full
resolution may occur at day three with nothing evident at 6–8 days. This may reflect good immunity or poor technique; it is
called “equivocal response” and requires revaccination.
Contact vaccinia: Vaccinia virus can be recovered from the vaccination site from the time of the papule (2–5 days after
vaccination) until the scab separates (14–21 days after vaccination); maximal shedding is at 4–14 days after vaccination and
might be of shorter duration with revaccination.
Nosocomial transmission of vaccina: This has rarely been described and the majority of cases involve direct person-to-person
transmission; the 2003 experience with 24,000 healthcare workers who received smallpox vaccination and continued to provide
patient care showed no nosocomial transmission.
Contraindications: The vaccine is contraindicated in potential recipients with the following conditions or household contacts
with these conditions: (1) history of eczema or atopic dermatitis; (2) other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions
including burns, impetigo, varicellaP.120
zoster, HSV, severe acne or psoriasis; (3) immunosuppression (HI V, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, solid organ
transplantation, cellular or humoral immunodeficiencies or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or high
dose steroids); (4) pregnancy; and (5) persons with coronary artery disease. The vaccine is contraindicated for potential
recipients (but not household contacts) who are breast-feeding, are less than one year of age (not recommended for persons
under 18 years), and those who are allergic to a vaccine component.
Pregnancy: The risk is small but fetal vaccinia is serious. During 1932–72, there were 20 affected pregnancies; 18 in vaccine
recipients and 2 with contact vaccinia. Of the 20 pregnancies, 7 occurred during the first trimester and 13 occurred in the second
trimester; only one of the 20 pregnancies was maintained to term and three survived. The vaccine is contraindicated in women
who are pregnant or plan pregnancy within four weeks. A urine pregnancy test should be available on the day scheduled for
vaccination. I nadvertent vaccination during pregnancy or pregnancy within four weeks should not be used as reason to terminate

pregnancy.
HIV infection: There has been one reported case of disseminated vaccinia in a patient with AI DS. There were also 732 recruits
vaccinated between 1981 and 1985 who subsequently had positive serology in 1985–88 without known consequences. This gives
a frequency of serious adverse events in this population of 0.14%. The 2003 military experience included inadvertent vaccination
of 10 HI V-infected recruits with CD4 counts >300/mm 3 ; all had “takes” and none had complications. Vaccination is not
recommended with HI V infection; mandatory HIV testing is not recommended, but the test should be available.
Major Adverse Events: (See Ann I ntern Med 2003;138:488.)
1. Encephalitis: Develops at 5–15 days after primary vaccination. The mortality rate is about 25%, residual sequelae are noted
in 25%, the virus is rarely detected in brain or CSF, natural history is completed in two weeks, it is not progressive and is
managed with supportive care only. This is more common in children under one year of age and accounts for the delay in
vaccination to the second year of life per a policy in the mid 1960s.
2. Progressive vaccinia: I n the 1960s, this was most common in persons with leukemia or agammaglobulinemia. At present,
the greatest concerns are for people with HI V, organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy, and other iatrogenic
immunosuppressive disorders. The complication is characterized by continued viral replication with continuous enlargement
and metastasis. Treatment is with VI G and possibly cidofovir.
3. Eczema vaccinatum: The condition is characterized by widespread vaccinal lesions in patients with eczema or history of
eczema. This complication in the 1960s was more common with contact vaccinia than a complication in vaccine recipients
due to exclusion of these patients for immunization. Treatment is with VI G, which reduces the
P.121
mortality rate from 10% to about 1% with supportive care similiar to that given to burn victims.
4. Accidental implantation: This occurs when patients touch the vaccination site and then touch another anatomical site. The
greatest concern is ocular involvement; about 6% with vaccinia in the eye develop vaccinal keratitis. VI G is controversial
because of animal studies that suggest an antigen-antibody cause.
5. Fetal vaccinia: This complication is exceedingly rare. Pregnant women exposed to smallpox should be vaccinated because
smallpox is associated with a mortality rate in pregnant women of up to 90% and fetal wastage nearly 100%.
6. Cardiac: Myocarditis at 1–3 weeks postvaccination. Most common with primary vaccination in white men in 20's; all military
recruits with this complication in 2003 recovered without sequelae. I schemic cardiac events (14 cases) and dilated
cardiomyopathy (4 cases) were noted in the 2003 experience with about 500,000 vaccinations but were probably unrelated.
Treatment of Adverse Events: Clinical trials with VI G or any other antiviral agent have not been done with humans. Cidofovir
may be used because of its in vitro activity against vaccinia.

Prophylactic Antibiotics in Surgery
Prophylaxis is recommended for procedures associated with high risk of infection, procedures involving
implantation of prosthetic material, and some procedures when infections are especially serious.
Cefazolin is usually preferred owing to the long half-life and established efficacy. Routine use of
vancomycin is discouraged due to promotion of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus ( Infect Control Hosp
Epidemiol 1995;16:105.). A single dose given preoperatively 30 min before the skin incision is usually
adequate; a second dose is often given if the procedure is long or is associated with large blood losses
or if the drug has a short half-life. Postoperative doses are usually unnecessary ( Med Lett
2001;43:93.).

Cefazolin 1–2 g IV q8h

Likely pathogens: S. aureus,
group A strep, clostridia

* Pre-op usually indicates administration with induction of anesthesia. Intra-op dose often given
with prolonged procedures. Optimal duration is usually unclear, but most studies show a single
dose is adequate. Use of more than a single pre-operative dose is arbitrary and usually
discouraged. When repeat dosing: cefazolin q4h, cefoxitin q4h, cefotetan q8h, clindamycin q8h,
vancomycin q12h. With cefazolin, obese patients should receive 2 g (Surgery 1989;106:750).
** Vancomycin preferred for hospitals with a high rate of wound infections caused by
methicillin-resistant S. aureus or S. epidermidis and for patients with allergy to penicillins or
cephalosporins. Hypotension is a common complication with rapid infusion and may occur even if
infused over 60 min. Treat with Benadryl and further slowing of infusion (J Thorac Cardiovasc
Surg 1992;104:1423). Hospitals should reduce all unnecessary vancomycin use due to concern
for possible promotion of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Ambulatory Patients
(Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:98.)
A. Prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever (Recommendation of AHA Committee on
Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis and Kawasaki Disease of the Council of Cardiovascular Disease in
the Young. JAMA 1992;268:2069.)
1. Indications
Rheumatic carditis: Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis well into adulthood and possibly
for life. This includes continued prophylaxis after valve surgery
Rheumatic fever without carditis: Continue until age of early 20s and 5 yr past last
rheumatic attack. Then reevaluate
2. Regimens
Preferred: Penicillin G benzathine 1.2 mil units IM every 4 wk
Alternatives: Penicillin V 250 mg po twice daily, sulfadiazine 1 g po once daily, or
erythromycin 250 mg po twice daily (allergy to penicillins and sulfonamides)
B. Meningococcal disease
Prevention and Control of Meningococcal Disease (MMWR 2000;29:RR-7.): This document
presents the CDC and the ACIP recommendations regarding control and prevention of
infections caused by N. meningitidis. The two issues of keen importance are recommendations

for meningococcal vaccine and the recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis.
Recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine:
1. Control of meningococcal outbreaks involving serogroup C.
2. Consideration for college freshman, particularly those living in dormitories and resident
halls so that the student and parents can make “individualized, informed decisions”
(MMWR 2000;49:RR-7.) (see below).
3. Routine use in high-risk patients including those with deficiencies in the terminal
complement components, persons who are asplenic and those who are routinely exposed
to N. meningitidis for research or laboratory work
4. Travelers to the “meningitidis belt” in sub-Saharan Africa extending from Senegal to
Ethiopia. Updated information about risk to travelers is available at the CDC:
877-394-8747 and on the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/travel/.
5. Efficacy is 90% for preventing meningococcal infection but does not appear to reduce
mortality in those who get infected despite vaccination (CID 2002;35:1376.)
Antimicrobial prophylaxis for contacts of patients with meningococcal disease: The
target population should include the following: household members, daycare center contacts,
and anyone exposed to the patient's oral secretions (kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,
or intubation). The drugs recommended for adults are:
P.134
rifampin (600 mg q12h × 4), ciprofloxacin (500 mg × 1), or ceftriaxone (250 mg IM × 1).
Recommendations for college students: The risk is small and the following
recommendations are made:
1. Students and parents should be informed about meningococcal disease and the benefits
of vaccination, but the ACIP does not recommend this as a routine vaccination strategy.
2. The risk for non-freshman students is about the same as for the general population.
3. The vaccine should be given to students at increased risk for meningococcal disease as
defined above.

4. This policy has been criticized as being vague and inconsistent ( JAMA 2001;286:720.)
C. Pneumococcal infection in asplenic patients(Recommendations of American Academy of
Pediatrics Redbook, 22nd Edition, 1991, pp 52–53, 373–378; Sickle Cell Disease Guideline Panel,
AHCPR Pub 93-0562, 1993, pp 39–42)
1. Indications Anatomically and functionally asplenic patients (including those with sickle cell
disease), especially children and adolescents; indications in adult patients are unclear
2. Regimens Pneumococcal, meningococcal, and H. influenzae type B vaccines
Preferred For adults and children >5 yr, penicillin V 250 mg po bid, usually for 2–4 yr in
children
Alternatives Penicillin G benzathine 1.2 mil units IM q4wk
D. Persons with cochlear implants (MMWR 2002;51:931.). This recommendation is based on
reports of meningitis in 53 such patients including pneumococcal meningitis in 16 of the 23
patients with a microbial pathogen detected
E. Prevention of recurrent bacterial UTIs in women (See Fihn SD: NEJM 2003;349:3.)
1. Indications Young to middle-aged nonpregnant women with L2 recurrent infections within 6
mo or L3 recurrent infections in 12 mo
2. Options
Continuous prophylaxis: Indications are two or more symptomatic infections in one six
month period or three or more in twelve months. Controlled trials show single daily doses
of TMP-SMX, TMP, nitrofurantoin or a fluoroquinolone reduces recurrences by 95% (Int J
Antimicrob Agents 2001;17:259.). This is usually given on a trial basis for six months but
has been shown to be effective without resistance ( Rev Infect Dis 1991;13:77.).
Postcoital prophylaxis may be used when there is a clear relationship with sex using a
single postcoital dose (Ann Intern Med 2001;135:9.)
P.135
Self-treatment: Most women can accurately diagnose recurrent cystitis and can be given

a three day supply of antibiotics. They should be instructed to get medical attention if the
symptoms persist for 48–72 hours.

Prevention of Bacterial Endocardits
Recommendations of the American Heart Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America, American
Dental Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Society for Gastrointestinal
Endoscopy (JAMA 1997;277:1794.; CID 1997;25:1448.; Med Lett 2001;43:98.)
A. CARDIAC CONDITIONS
Cardiac conditions considered at risk (not all inclusive)
a. High Risk
Prosthetic cardiac valve, including bioprosthetic and homograph valves
Prior endocarditis
Complex cyanotic congenital heart disease
Surgically constructed systemic pulmonary shunts
b. Moderate Risk
Rheumatic and other acquired valvular dysfunction (even after valve surgery)
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS)
Mitral valve prolapse with valve regurgitation (patients with mitral valve prolapse
associated with thickening and/or redundancy of the valve may be at increased risk,
especially men age $ 45 yr)

Prophylaxis not recommended
Isolated secundum atrial septal defect
Surgical repair without residual >6 mo of secundum atrial defect, ventricular septal
defect, or patent ductus or arteriosus (without residual beyond 6 mo)
Prior coronary bypass surgery
Mitral valve defect without regurgitation (see above)
Physiologic or functional heart murmurs
Prior rheumatic fever without valve disease
Cardiac pacemakers and implanted defibrillators
Prior Kawasaki's disease without valve dysfunction
B. Procedures
Endocarditis prophylaxis recommended
Dental procedures: Extractions; periodontal procedures—surgery, scaling, root planing,
probing; dental implant, root canal, subgingival placement of antibiotic strips; initial
placement of orthodontic bands; intraligamentary local anesthetic injections, and tooth
cleaning if bleeding is anticipated
Note: Three major studies have challenged the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics before
dental procedures to prevent endoarditis (Arch Intern Med 1992;152:1869.; Lancet
1992;339:135.; and Ann Intern Med 1998;129:761.). Some authorities recommend
prophylaxis only with extractions and gingival surgery and only when the risk is a
prosthetic valve or previous endocarditis (Ann Intern Med 1998;129:829.).
Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy
Surgical procedures that involve intestinal or respiratory mucosa
Bronchoscopy with a rigid bronchoscope

Sclerotherapy for esophageal varices*
Esophageal dilation*
P.139
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with biliary obstruction*
Surgical procedures that involve intestinal mucosa*
Gallbladder surgery*
Cystoscopy
Urethral dilation
Endocarditis prophylaxis not recommended**
Dental procedures: Restorative dentistry, local anesthesia, intracanal endodontic
treatment, placement of rubber dams, suture removal, placement of removable
prosthodontic or orthopedic appliances, fluoride treatments, impressions, orthodontic
appliance adjustment, shedding of primary teeth
Endotracheal intubation
Tympanostomy tube insertion
Bronchoscopy with flexible bronchoscopy with or without biopsy**
Transesophageal echocardiography
Endoscopy of GI tract with or without biopsy**
Cardiac catheterization including balloon angiopathy
Transesophageal echocardiography **
Implanted cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators, and coronary stents
Incision and drainage of prepped sites
Circumcision

Vaginal hysterectomy**
Vaginal delivery**
Cesarean section
Genitourinary surgery in uninfected tissue: urethral catheterization, uterine dilation and
curettage, therapeutic abortion, sterilization procedures, or insertion or removal of
intrauterine device
Recommended Regimens Based on recommendations of the American Heart Association (JAMA
1997;227:1794.; CID 1997;25:1454.; Med Letter 2001;43:98.)
C. Dental, oral and upper respiratory procedures
Standard
Amoxicillin: 2.0 g po 1 hr before procedure
Alternatives: Penicillin V, 2 g po 1 hr pre-procedure; then 1 g 6 hr after first dose
Amoxicillin or penicillin allergy
Clindamycin 600 mg po 1 hr pre-procedure or
Cephalexin or cefadroxil, 2 g po 1 hr pre-procedure or
Azithromycin or clarithromycin, 500 mg po 1 hr pre-procedure
Cannot take oral medications
Ampicillin 2.0 g IM or IV 30 min pre-procedure
Amoxicillin or penicillin allergy and unable to take oral medicines
Clindamycin 600 mg IV within 30 min pre-procedure or
Cefazolin 1 g IM or IV within 30 min pre-procedure
P.140
D. Genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures

High risk*: Ampicillin, 2 g IM or IV plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg IM or IV × 30 min of start-ing
procedure; 6 hr later ampicillin 1 g IV or amoxicillin 1 g po
High risk plus penicillin allergy: Vancomycin 1 g IV over 1–2 hr plus gentamicin 1.5 mg// kg
IV or IM (J 120 mg) complete infusion within 30 min of starting procedure
Moderate risk: Amoxicillin, 2 g po 1 hr pre-procedure or ampicillin 2.0 g IM or IV within 30
min of starting procedure
Moderate risk plus penicillin allergy: Vancomycin 1 g IV over 1–2 hr; complete infusion within
30 min of starting the procedure
E. Miscellaneous issues (CID 1997;25:1454.)
Target organisms: Upper respiratory tract procedures— S. viridans; GI and GU procedures—E.
faecalis
Patients already receiving an antibiotic: Pick from a different class. Thus, if receiving a
beta-lactam, use clindamycin, clarithromycin, or axithromycin
Anticoagulated patients: Avoid IM injections of antibiotics
Procedures involving infected tissue : Treat cause of infection
Cardiac surgery candidates: Antibiotic prophylaxis advocated, usually a first generation
cephalosporin or vancomycin
Cardiac transplant recipients: Experience is very limited, but most treat as the moderate-risk
category
Endocarditis experience: Most cases of strep viridans endocarditis have not followed dental
procedures; most procedure related endocarditis occurs within 2 wk of the procedure
Effectiveness of prophylaxis: Efficacy of prophylaxis has never been shown (CID 1999;29:1.).
Nevertheless, most infectious disease-trained physi-cians follow these guidelines, mainly
because of the liability risk rather than the supporting science ( CID 2002;34:1621.).
F. GProphylaxis for Dental, Gastrointestinal, or Genitourinary Procedures in Patients with
Prosthetic Joints

1. Analysis by Gillespie showed no evidence of benefit (Infect Dis Clin North Am 1990;4:465.).
2. Review in CID 1995;20:1420.: Patients with prosthetic joints do not require prophylaxis for
dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary procedures; possible exceptions are long procedures,
surgery in infected area (e.g., periodontal disease), and other procedures with a high risk of
bacteremia (Med Lett 1995;37:79.; J Bone Joint Surg 1996;78-A:1755.).
3. Updated statement of American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and American Dental
Association (J Am Dent Assoc 1997;128:1004.): Prophylaxis is not indicated for dental
patients with pins, plates, and screws, and it is not routinely indicated for most dental
patients with total joint replacements. However, it is advisable to consider prophylaxis in a
small number of patients who may be at potential increased risk of hematogenous total joint
infection.

Footnotes
*Prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk patients and is considered optional for medium-risk patients.
**Prophylaxis is optional for high-risk patients.
*High risk: Prosthetic valve, history of endocarditis or surgically constructed systemic shunts or
conduits or complex cyanotic congenital heart disease.

1993;16:616.; Infect Dis Clin North Am 1998;12:301.)
1. Risk
High-risk areas (incidence 20–50%): Developing countries of Latin America, Africa,
Middle East, and Asia
Intermediate risk: Southern Europe and some Caribbean islands
Low risk: Canada, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, United States
2. Agents
E. coli (enterotoxigenic—most common, enteroinvasive, enteroadherent)
Shigella
Campylobacter jejuni
Aeromonas (especially Thailand)
Plesiomonas shigelloides
Salmonella sp
Non-cholera vibrios (coastal Asia)
Rotavirus (Mexico)
Norovirus (cruise ships)
Giardia (North America and Russia)
Cryptosporidium (Russia)

E. histolytica (Rare)
3. Prevention
Safe foods: Food served fresh and steaming hot; dry food (e.g., bread); hyperosmolar
food (e.g., jellies, acidic fruits); fruit that is self-peeled; alcoholic beverages; carbonated
beverages; water that is filtered and iodinized
Avoid: Salads, cold foods, sauces, cream-filled desserts, raw seafood, raw meat, soft
cheeses, tapwater, ice
4. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (CID 2000;31:1079.)
a. Candidates for prophylaxis Travelers with important underlying health problem (active
IBD, type I diabetes, elderly person with heart disease, AIDS) Trip will be ruined if
traveler has brief illness Traveler requests chemoprophylaxis and/or is unwilling to follow
dietary instructions (consider bismuth subsalicylate)
b. Recommended regimens for selected patients (see a)

Regimen

Cost/d

Bismuth subsalicylate
2–262 mg tabs qid*

Comment

$3.40

Less effective than antimicrobials; few side
effects*

$3.80
$4.51
$4.92
$8.52

Fluoroquinolones are most predictably
effective drugs; concern is abuse, resistance,
cost, and side effects

Fluoroquinolones (once daily)

Norfloxacin 400 mg/d
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg/d
Ofloxacin 300 mg/d
Levofloxacin 500 mg/d

* Pepto-Bismol turns tongue and stools black, sometimes causes tinnitis, may reduce
absorption of doxycycline (sometimes given for malaria prophylaxis), and should not
be taken with salicylates or anticoagulants and should not be taken >3 wk.

5. Treatment of traveler's diarrhea (CID 2000;31:1079.)
(http://www.cdc.gov/travel accessed 8/1/03)

Clinical feature

a

and CDC

Treatment options

Mild (or moderate diarrhea: N3
loose stools/8 hrs with no loose
stools/d) Fever or blood

No treatment or loperamide 4 mg, then 2 with
each loose stool up to 16 mg/d or bismuth
subsalicylate 2–262 mg tabs qid

Severe: Diarrhea is severe (N 3
stools/8 hrs), associated with
fever or bloody stools

Loperamide × fluoroquinolone b
1. Norfloxacin 400 mg po bid × 3 d
2. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid × 3 d
3. Levofloxacin 500 mg qd × 3 d
Pregnancy: Loperamide + azithromycin 1000 mg
× 1 or 500 mg qd × 3 d

a

The 3-day course of treatment appears superior to single dose treatment for
salmonellosis (AAC 1989;33:1101; JID 1992;165:1557) and for shigellosis due to S.
dysenteriae type 1 (Ann Intern Med 1992;117:727). A study of shigellosis in Thailand

failed to show loperamide is contraindicated when given with a quinolone (Ann Intern
Med 1985;102:582).
b

Rates of C. jejuni fluoroquinolone resistance are 20–25% in U.S., 60–80% in
Taiwan, Thailand, and Spain (Emerg Infect Dis 2001;7:24).

6. Oral rehydration: Potable fruit juice, caffeine-free soft drinks, salted crackers. Severe
symptoms: WHO Oral Rehydration Salts. Ingredients/L water: NaCl 3.5 g (3/4 tsp), trisodium
citrate 2.9 g (could use 1 tsp baking soda) and glucose 20 g, KCl 1.5 g (1 cup orange juice or
bananas). Packets of oral rehydration salts are available from Cera Products, Jessup, MD
(888-237-2598) and Jianas Bros, Kansas City, MO (816-421-2880)
7. Antibiotic resistance: Rate of resistance by Shigella, Salmonella, and E. coli is 50–90% for
tetracycline and 35–76% for TMP-SMX (Infect Dis Clin North Am 6:333, 1992). Quinolone
resistance is increasing. About 50% of campylobacter strains in Thailand are resistant to
ciprofloxacin (J Trav Med 1994;1:119.)
C. MALARIA PROPHYLAXIS (CDC Health Information for International Travel 1996–97, U.S.

P.143
Risk areas: Most areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola, sub-Saharan Africa, the
Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania. During 1998 there were
1,227 reported cases of malaria in the U.S. including 43% P. falciparum, 38% P. vivax, 3.5%
P. malariae, and 2.1% P. ovale (MMWR 2001;50:55–5.). Areas of acquisition included Africa
(60%), Asia (20%), Central America and Caribbean (19%). Of the 1,227 cases at least 73%
were U.S. citizens who did not receive malaria prophylaxis. There were 4 deaths attributed to

malaria for a mortality rate of 0.3%.
Drug resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine (CRPF) is probable or confirmed in all
countries with P. falciparum except Central America west of the Panama Canal Zone, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic, Egypt, and most of the Middle East. Resistance to both Fansidar and
chloroquine is widespread in Thailand, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Cambodia, and the Amazon
basin of South America and has been reported in sub-Saharan Africa. Resistance to mefloquine
has been reported primarily in Thailand. There is no documented resistance to tetracycline.
Advice to travelers (Med Lett 2002;44:33.)
1. Personal protection:
a. Transmission is most common between dusk and dawn.
b. Precautions include remaining in well-screened areas and using mosquito nets,
clothing that covers most of the body, insect repellent containing DEET on exposed
areas, and pyrethroid containing insect spray for environs and clothing. Permethrin
may also be sprayed on clothing.

COMPARISON OF AMPHOTERICIN PREPARATIONS LIPID FORMULATIONS OF AMPHOTERICIN B: IDSA GUIDELINES
(CID 2000;30:653.; CID 2003;37:415.)
Potential advantages com pared with conven tion al amphote ricin B: Increased daily dose (up to 10-fold); high tissu e concen tration , e specially in RE system (l ungs, sple en,
liver), reduced infu sion related re action s (especially Am Bisome ), substan tial decrease i n n ephrotoxicity
Disadvantages compared with conve ntion al amphotericin B: the lipid-based form ulati ons are much more e xpensive : Am phote ricin B: $11/d; Am Bisome : $800–$1500/d;
Abelcet: $640/d; Am phote c: $480–640/d (ave rage whole sale price, 2003)

Treatment of Mycobacterial Infections
I. Tuberculosis
Guidelines of CDC, American Thoracic Society, and Infectious Diseases Society of America ( Am J Respir Crit Care Med
2003;167:603.; MMWR 2003;52:RR-11.; NEJM 2001;345:189.)
A. Treatment
1. Four drug treatments preferred for initial empiric treatment: Isoniazid (INH), rifampin (Rif), pyrazinamide
(PZA), and ethambutol (EMB).
2. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is preferred for all patients. Priorities for DOT: Pulmonary TB with positive
smear, treatment failure, relapse, drug resistance, HIV co-infection, current or prior drug abuse, psychiatric
illness, memory impairment, or prior non-adherence.
3. Susceptibility tests should be performed on the initial isolate and on any isolate obtained at 3 mo
post-treatment (failure to convert).
4. Future therapy: Fluoroquinolones are the most promising new agents (BMJ 2002;325:1282.).
5. Monitoring: Some recommend routine baseline LFTs and periodic monitoring due to hepatotoxicity of INH, PZA,
and rifampin. Increases in ALT in up to 20%, but major liver disease in <1% (BMJ 2002;325:1282.)
6. Relapse: Probability of relapse is <5%; most occur within 6 months and involve drug sensitive strains.
7. Resistant strains: Give 4 active drugs, usually 3 oral and one parenteral aminoglycoside.

B. Diagnostic Tests
1. AFB smear: Sensitivity of AFB stain with expectorated sputum, induced sputum and bronchoscopy aspirates are
similar at 40–60% in culture positive cases (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;162:2238.). Specificity depends on
the prevalence of TB and MOTT, but may be as low as 50% (J Clin Micro 1998;36:1046.)
P.165
2. Nucleic acid amplification (NAA assays) (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001;164:2020.): Commercially available
as MTB (Gen Probe) and Amplicor (Roche) at $50–100/assay. Sensitivity of NAA assays is 80–84% including
virtually all smear-positive cases and about half of smear-negative/culture-positive cases. CDC
recommendations (MMWR 2000;49:593.):
AFB smear and NAA on the first sputum collected. If the smear is positive and the NAA is positive, TB is
diagnosed with near 100% certainty.
If the smear is positive and the NAA is negative, the sputum should be tested for inhibitors by spiking the
sample with lysed M. tuberculosis and repeat the assay. If inhibitors are not present, the patient is
assumed to have MOTT.
If the smear is negative and the NAA is positive, additional sputum samples are recommended. If positive,
the patient is presumed to have TB.
If both the smear and the NAA are negative, additional specimens should be tested by NAA and, if negative,
TB is assumed to be excluded.

3. AFB culture: Frequency of false positive results in a review of 14 studies with >100 patients show a mean of
3.1% false positives (CID 2000;31:1390.). The presumed mechanism is laboratory cross-contamination. The
major clue is a single positive culture, especially if not supported by clinical observations.
4. Broth-based cultures: When combined with DNA probes, broth-based cultures are capable of detecting M.
tuberculosis within two weeks with smear-positive cases and within three weeks with smear-negative cases (Am
J Clin Path 2000;113:770.; Diag Microbiol Infect Dis 2000;37:31.)
C. Monitoring Drug Therapy
1. Monitoring for adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
a. Most frequent reactions with standard 4 drug therapy are rash ± fever, hepatitis, and GI intolerance. The
main cause of hepatotoxicity appears to be PZA (Am J Resp Crit Care Med 2003;167:1472.). Ethambutol is
a rare cause of toxicity except for occasional cases of dose-related vision changes.
b. Recommendations
INH: Baseline and monthly LFTs if pre-existing liver disease, or development of abnormal LFTs that do
not require discontinuing INH Monthly inquiries about symptoms that suggest hepatitis
RIF: No monitoring for ADRs
PZA: LFTs as for INH; uric acid is usually elevated, but usually is not consequential and monitoring is
not recommended
EMB: Baseline visual acuity and Ishihara test of color discrimination. Inquire about vision changes at
each monthly visit and warn to contact clinic immediately if vision changes. Monthly tests of acuity
and color discrimination with doses >15–20 mg/kg for >2 months or with renal failure
2. Duration of therapy with drug-sensitive strains

Continuation phase:
Q80 doses: No additional therapy
<80% doses
Duration of interruption <3 months: Continue, if not completed in 6 months—restart

Duration of interruption Q3 months: Restart 4 drug initial phase
4. Evaluation of response: Symptoms usually improve within 4 wk, and 85% of patients treated with
INH-rifampin containing regimen convert sputum culturees to negative by the end of 2 mo. Sputum smear and
culture should be performed at least monthly until conversion is documented. Weekly sputum smears with
quantitation are encouraged. Patients with positive sputum cultures after 2 mo of treatment need reevaluation,
drug susceptibility test, and directly observed treatment. If resistance noted, give at least two active drugs
under DOT. Patients with negative cultures T2 mo should have one additional smear and culture at completion
of treatment. Some recommend x-ray at 2–3 mo and at completion of treatment.
5. Relapse: Most relapses occur within 6 months and involve drug sensitive strains. Major risks are: (1) extent
and severity of the lung disease as indicated by cavitation and bilateral infiltrates, and (2) positive cultures at
two months (Lancet 2002;360:528.)
D. Special Considerations With Treatment
1. HIV Infection
Identical for general population except:
CD4 <100/mm 3 : Continuation phase should be daily or 3×/week
Once weekly rifapentine regimen should not be used.
Positive cultures at 2 months: Strongly consider 7 month continuation phase (total 9 mo.)
In absence of prior HIV therapy and CD4 <350/mm 3 : Delay antiretroviral drugs for 4–8 weeks.
RIF may be used with 2 NRTIs + EFV, RTV + SQV (Invirase or Fortovase) or AZT/3TC/ABC.
Rifabutin combined with other PIs and NNRTI requires a dose adjustment of both. See:
http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/ or http://www.medscape.com/updates/quickguide
When starting NNRTI or PI in patient receiving RIF, substitute rifabutin 2 weeks prior to NNRTI or PI to give
a 2 week washout period for RIF
Paradoxical reaction: Frequency in 7–36%; clinical features—high fever; increased adenopathy, CNS
lesions, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions. Treatment is symptomatic; if severe, give prednisone 1
mg/kg and reduce dose at 1–2 weeks.
P.167

II. Preventive Treatment for Tuberculosis Infection in the U.S.
ATS/CDC Statement Committee on Latent Tuberculosis Infection [MMWR 2000;49(RR-6).; Am J Resp Crit Care Med
2000;161:S221.; MMWR 2003;52:735.)
A. Testing (NEJM 2002;347:1860.)
1. Testing methods: The traditional method is the PPD skin test which has been used for more than 100 years. A
new test has been approved by the FDA which mesures the release of interferon-gamma in blood following
stimulation by PPD (JAMA 2001;286:1740.). At present, the usual test is the traditional PPD skin test with the
following characteristics:
Standard test: 5 tuberculin units given intracutaneously and read at 48–72 hours, although reading up to
one week is considered accurate (ARRD 1986;134:1043.).
BCG: In one study, only 8% of those given BCG vaccine at birth had a positive PPD skin test at 15 years
(ARRD 1992;145:621.). BCG is given in countries that have the highest incidence of tuberculosis making it
difficult to discount a positive PPD. The current recommendation is to ignore BCG vaccination when
interpreting PPD skin tests.

Sensitivity: 10–20% of persons with tuberculosis have negative skin tests (NEJM 1971;285:1506.; Chest
1980;77:32.).
Anergy testing: Most authorities no longer recommend it.
Boosting: The concern is that a negative test may boost the size of the reaction with a second test. The
recommendation is that persons who undergo annual PPD skin tests such as health care workers should
undergo two-step testing on initial evaluation with the second PPD given one week after a negative test.

C. Antimicrobial regimens (MMWR 2003;52:735.)
1. Recommended regimens
INH 300 mg/d × 9 mo
INH 300 mg/d × 6 mo (not for HIV co-infection or patients with fibrotic lesions on chest x-ray)
INH 900 mg 2 ×/wk (DOT) × 9 mo
INH 900 mg 2 ×/wk (DOT) × 6 mo (not for HIV co-infection or patients with fibrotic lesions on chest x-ray)
Rifampin 600 mg/d × 4 mo (contacts of patients with INH resistant, rifampin susceptible strains)
Note: The 2 month course of RIF + PZA is no longer recommended due to high rates of hepatotoxicity
(MMWR 2003;52:735.)
INH regimen
Efficacy: Studies of more than 70,000 participants show efficacy of about 60% in reducing active
tuberculosis (Bibl Tuberc 1970;26:28.). Most studies were done with one year of therapy; a study of
INH for six months showed 65% efficacy (Bull WHO 1982;60:555.).

Hepatitis: Increases in serum transaminase levels occur in 10–20%, but symptomatic hepatitis is
uncommon with about one case per 1,000 (JAMA 1992;281:1014.). The risk increases with alcohol
consumptoin and with increasing age, but age is no longer considered in the recommendations for
treatment.
Peripheral neuropathy: Allegedly occurs in up to 2% (Am Rev Tuberc 1954;70:504.) and may be
prevented with pyridoxine (Tubercle 1980;61:191.).
Current recommendations: INH for 6–9 months in the usual dose of 300 mg/day, monthly clinical
monitoring, baseline transaminase levels only in persons with risk factors for hepatitis, abstinence
from alcohol during the INH course and suspension of treatment if transaminase levels exceed the
upper limit of normal by five-fold. The alternative regimen is 900 mg twice weekly by directly observed
therapy.
Rifampin regimen
Efficacy: Thought to be equivalent to INH (ARRD 1992;145:36.).
P.170
Adverse reactions: Uncommon.
Drug interactions: Common and often important.
Current recommendations: 600 mg/day for four months with clinical monitoring at monthly intervals,
baseline transaminase measurements only for persons at risk for hepatitis, and concern for drug
interactions such as protease inhibitors, warfarin, contraceptive pills, and methadone.
D. Monitoring
Laboratory monitoring: INH
No lab tests at baseline unless the following:HIV infection, pregnancy, or<3 mo postpartum, history of liver
disease (HCV, HBV, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis), persons who use EtOH daily
Baseline lab tests: AST, ALT, and bilirubin
Active hepatitis and end-stage liver disease are relative contraindications to INH and PZA
Follow-up lab tests: symptoms of hepatotoxicity—D/C INH if AST/ALT Q3×ULN + symptoms or AST/ALT>5 ×
ULN without symptoms
Clinical monitoring: Monitor for symptoms of hepatotoxicity at baseline and every mo for INH regimen.

Treatment and comment
RIF + EMB + INH ± AK 15–18 mo (AK for extensive disease)
RIF + EMB × 9 mo
RIF + EMB + clarithromycin or azithromycin × 9 mo
RIF + EMB + AK × 9 mo
Contraindication or resistance to RIF: EMB + CIP + clarithromycin

M. avium

Pulmonary and
extrapulmonary

Thymidine kinase deficient
strains are most common
cause of resistance and are
almost always from
immunosuppressed patients
unresponsive to acyclovir
(NEJM 1991; 325:551; NEJM
1989;320:293; J Infect Dis
1990;161:1078).
Most acyclovir-resistant
strains are also resistant to
famciclovir, penciclovir, and
ganciclovir, but respond to
foscarnet (CID
1998;27:1525)
Foscarnet-resistant HSV
may become acyclovir

susceptible (JID
1994;109:193); most
acyclovir-resistant HSV are
resistant to penciclovir
(Famciclovir) and ganciclovir

VARICELLA-ZOSTER (see Ann Intern Med 130:922, 1999)

Chickenpox, adult
immunocompetent

Valacyclovir: 1 g po tid × 5
days

Treat as quickly as possible

Pneumonia

Acyclovir: IV 10–12 mg/kg
q8h × 7 days ($1058)
Valacyclovir: 1 g po tid × 10

(RID 1990;12:788)

Dermatomal or
disseminated zoster;
immunosup-pressed

Acyclovir: IV 10 mg/kg q8h
× 7 days ($1075)

Indications to treat are
greater for severe disease,
early disease, or zoster in
immuno-suppressed host

(NEJM 1983;308:1448; AmJ
Med 1988;85 Suppl 2A:84;
Infect Dis Clin Pract
1993;2:100)
Treatment can be started as
long as new lesions are
forming
Foscarnet for
acyclovir-resistant strains,
60 mg/kg IV 2–3 ×/day for
7–14 days (NEJM

(Ann Intern Med
1996;125:376)
Pain control: Tricyclics; other
options—gabapentin,
carbamazepine, lidocaine

Antiviral drugs hasten
healing of cutaneous lesions
and reduce pain including
acyclovir (Am J Med
1988;85:84; NZ Med J
1991; 10 Suppl 102:93);
valacyclovir (AAC 1996;
39:1546); and famciclovir
(Ann Intern Med
1995;123:89)
Patient > 50 yr and those
with ophthalmic zoster are
most likely to benefit
Ophthalmic zoster: Consult
ophthalmologist

patch, topical capsaicin,
regional nerve block,
acupuncture. Narcotics are
effective and under-used

(Ophthalmology
1986;793:63)
Antiviral treatment should
be started within 72 hr of
rash onset or while lesions
are still forming
Meta-analysis of reports of
oral acyclovir in 691
patients with zoster showed
a 2-fold reduc-tion in
duration of pain (CID
1996;22:341)
Comparative trial of
acyclovir vs. valacyclovir
showed slight advantage
with valacyclovir (AAC
1995;39:1546)
Controlled trial showed
prednisone added to
acyclovir was associated
with more rapid healing,
more rapid return to normal
sleep, and more rapid return
to normal activity (Ann
Intern Med 1996;125:376).
Others have shown less
impressive results (NEJM
1994;330:896)
Valacyclovir is superior to

B. INFLUENZA (MMWR 2000;49(RR-3).)
1. PREVENTION
Vaccination: Preferred method to prevent influenza. Vaccine efficacy in healthy persons
shows 70–90% efficacy when there is a good match between vaccine strain and epidemic
strain. This has occurred in 13 of the last 14 seasons; the exception was the 1997–98
season when the epidemic was H 3 N 2 -Sydney. Vaccination “spin off” includes protection of
vulnerable elderly residents of nursing homes when the health care workers who serve
them have flu vaccine (JID 1997;75:.; Lancet 2000;355:93.). The optimal time to
vaccinate is Oct—mid November (see p 104 for vaccination guidelines)

2. DIAGNOSIS
a. Clinical: Physician diagnosed flu is about 70% specific, about the same as the rapid
tests. Key clues are fever, epidemic of influenza, and typical respiratory tract symptoms
(Arch Intern Med 2000;160;3082.).
b. Rapid tests for office use: Flu O1A (Biostar), QuickView (Quidel), and Zstatflu
(ZymaTx). These cost $15–20/test, results available in 10–20 min, and sensitivity of
57–77%. All three will distinguish influenza A and B. Medical Letter consultants
considered QuickVue to be “the easiest and fastest” ( Med Lett 1999;41:121.)
3. TREATMENT MMWR 2000;49(RR-3).; JAMA 1999;282:1240.; Lancet 2000;355:1845.; BMJ
2003;326:1235..
Meta-analysis of published reports showed neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment had an
average 1–2 day reduction in symptoms and a 30% reduction in antibiotic use; for prevention
there was 69–92% efficacy for prevention (BMJ 2003;326:1235.)

C. HEPATITIS VIRUSES
1. Hepatitis C: Current recommendations for management NIH Consensus Conference:
Managment of Hepatitis C, 2002 (http://consensus.nih.gov/cons/116/116cdc_statement.htm)
a. Natural history: 85% develop chronic infection (viral persistence > 6 mo usually with
elevated ALT). About 10–20% develop cirrhosis within 20 yr, and 1–5% develop
hepatocellular carcinoma within 20 yr (NEJM 1992;327:1906.; NEJM 1995;332:1463.).
Extrahepatic manifestations include arthritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, lichen planus,
glomerulonephritis, and essential mixed cryogobulinemia.
b. Laboratory tests (see J Clin Micro 2002;40:4407.)
1. EIA: Standard screening test: Reliable, inexpensive, and FDA arproved; 3rd
generation tests show sensitivity and specificity > 99% in immunocompetent
patients
False negatives: Rare, but seen with hemodialysis and HIV
False positives: Autoimmune disorders
Confirmatory tests: May be unnecessary with liver disease and risk.
Others—qualitative HCV RNA
2. Qualitative HCV RNA with threshold of detection of 50 IU/mL (100 viral

genes/mL)—Confirmatory test
Specificity: >98%, positive confirms EIA; negative may reflect transient decline and
should be repeated
Use: Confirmation of EIA and determination if acute infection cleared
P.198
3. Quantitative HCV RNA: Monitor response
Techniques: PCR (qPCR) or branched DNA (bDNA)
Units: IU is not actual viral particles
Use: Monitor response to therapy
Not useful for prognosis
4. ALT: Weak association with severity of liver disease; useful to monitor response to
treatment but pegylate interferon can cause elevated ALT. 30% with chronic HCV
have normal ALT levels, some progress to cirrhosis
5. Liver biopsy: Used to:
Detect other causes of liver disease; iron, steatosis, alcoholic liver disease, etc.
Baseline for subsequent evaluation
Basis for therapy (although the 80% response rate with genotype 2 or 3 may
preclude need for liver biopsy)
6. Hepatocellular carcinoma
Incidence: 0–3% per year with HCV—associated cirrhosis
Screening: alpha-fetoprotein or ultrasound; some screen with one or both q6
mo but no standard based on adequate study and no need in absence of
cirrhosis
c. Results with treatment using pegylated interferon + ribavirin (NEJM 2002;347:975.;

Lancet 2001;258:958.)

Clinical trials

Genotype 1

Genotype 2,3

Interferon and pegylated
interferon are equivalent

Sustained viral
response (SVR)

42–46% w/Rx 48 wks

76–82% w/Rx 24 wks

d. Indications to treat
1. HCV RNA levels >50 IU/mL and
2. Liver biopsy showing portal or bridging fibrosis and at least moderate inflammation
and necrosis (most have persistently elevated ALT) and
3. No contraindications (especially active IDU, alcoholism, neuropsychiatric disorder
and other co-morbidities)
4. Decompensated liver disease—transplant is treatment choice
5. Acute HVC: Treat, but timing is unclear
6. Co-morbidities
Active IDU: Case-by-case decision
HIV: Case-by-case decison (Response is reduced and methods to sequence
treatment of HIV and HCV are unclear)
EtOH: Heavy consumption (>80 g/d compromises HCV Rx)

e. Treatment
1. Genotype 1: Pegylated interferon + ribavirin × 48 weeks*
2. Genotype 2 or 3: Pegylated interferon + ribavirin or interferon + ribavirin × 24
weeks*
3. Retreatment
Nonresponders: May have improved histology 15–20% of nonresponders to
interferon-ribavirin respond to pegylated interferon-ribavirin
Relapse: Most relapse again if given same regimen
4. Side effects of interferon: Dose related. Dose reduction is required in 10–40%;
treatment is discontinued because of side effects in 10–20%. The major side effects
follow.
P.199
Flu-like symptoms—fever, chills, headache, arthralgias, myalgia, tachycardia; most
patients experience these effects early in therapy, but they improve with continued
treatment and acetaminophen therapy.
Hematologic—reduced neutrophil and platelet counts may occur and require dose
reduction or supportive therapy.
Late side effects—fatigue, myalgias, bone marrow suppression, rash, autoimmune
thyroid disorders, alopecia, irritability, and neuropsychiatric effects (especially
depression).
Rare side effects—autoimmune disease, suicide risk, cardiac failure, renal failure,
hearing loss, pulmonary fibrosis, retinopathy.
Ribavirin—most patients develop hemolytic anemia that may require dose reduction.
Ribavirin may cause gout and is teratogenic.
2. Hepatitis B
Indications to treat: (1) detectable HBsAg±HBeAg; HBV DNA (usually >100,000 c/mL), and

(2) liver histology showing necroinflammation (Hepatology 2001;34:1225.). FDA approved
agents include interferon and nucleosides/nucleotides.
a. Interferon-alfa: Meta-analysis of 15 trials involving 837 patients with doses of 7–30
MU/m 2 /wk showed trends favoring treatment in all studies, improvement in all disease
markers with treatment, and superior results with high doses (>5 MU/m 2 /wk) (Ann Intern
Med 1993;119:312.). About 33% showed disappearance of HBeAg with interferon versus
12% in controls (NEJM 1997;336:347.). Current recommendations are:
5 million units/d or 10 million units SC 3 ×/wk × 4 mo (30–35 million units/wk).
Lower doses are less effective, and higher doses are usually too toxic. Drug costs
about $5,400 (AWP).
Monitor ALT levels at 2- to 4-wk intervals; HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA at baseline;
at end of treatment and 6 mo later. Increase in aminotransferase levels should not
lead to discontinuation.
Best response is with high baseline aminotransferase, low HBV DNA, active histologic
changes indicating inflammation and necrosis, fibrosis, short duration before
therapy, and absence of complicating disease (NEJM 1990;323:295.; Am J
Gastroenterol 1993;88:1887.; Ann Intern Med 1993:119:312.).
b. Nucleoside analogs:
1. Lamivudine (NEJM 1998;339:61.): Administration of 100 mg lamivudine (3TC) po for
1 yr was associated with ALT normalization in 72% of patients, HBeAg
seroconversion in 16%, improvement in hepatic necroinflammation in 56% of
patients and a sustained virologic response in about 50% at one year (NEJM
1998;339:61.; NEJM 1998;341:1256.). Low frequency of side effects make
lamivudine a first line therapy for chronic hepatitis B. However, drug resistance with
the YMDD mutation occurs at a rate of about 15% per yr (NEJM 2003;348:800.).
One recommendation is to treat patients with HBeAg until they are negative for e
antigen of there is drug resistance (BMJ 2003;323:1164.).
2. Adefovr (NEJM 2003;348:800.): Administration of 10 mg/d po × 48 wks showed
statistically significant improvement in HBV DNA quantitative counts and in

histologic changes. The optimal duration of treatment is unclear but may be lifelong.
Resistance in vitro is only about 2% with treatment × 1 year and the drug appears
to be well tolerated (NEJM 2003;348:800.; NEJM 2003;348:808.).
3. Tenofovir: Highly active against HBV but not FDA approved for this indication. Like
adofovir it is well tolerated and does not seem to induce resistance.
P.200
4. Combination: Despite the theoretical rationale for combination therapy, there are
few data to support the use of interferon and nucleoside analoges at present.
3. Chronic hepatitis D: Efficacy demonstrated for interferon-alfa in patients with the following
criteria: positive HBsAg, anti-HDV IgG and IgM, positive HDV RNA × 3, alanine
aminotransferase C 2 × upper limit of normal × 6 mo, histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis
and positive intrahepatic HDV antigen. Patients with advanced cirrhosis were excluded.
Optimal regimen was 9 million units IM 3 ×/wk for 48 wk. Response, which was generally
transient, was shown by normal alanine transferase and elimination of serum HDV RNA in 7 of
14 patients vs 0 of 13 placebo recipients (NEJM 1994; 330:88.; JAMA 1999;282:511.).
D. HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME
1. Definition (MMWR 2002;51 RR-9.; CID 2002;34:1224.)
Clinical features: HPS due to Sin Nombre virus has a median incubation period of 14–17 days,
a prodrome of 3–5 days, and clinical features consisting initially of myalgias, GI symptoms
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and fever. A clue to the diagnosis in the prodrome stage is
thrombocytopenia. The second stage is characterized by cardiopulmonary involvement with
tachypnea, tachycardia, cough, and postural hypotension. The complete blood count is highly
characteristic with hemoconcentration, leukocytosis with a left shift, thrombocytopenia and
circulating immunoblasts that may resemble atypical lymphocytes. By 48 hours postadmission
most patients have DIC with typical x-ray changes. The mortality rate is 38% in 344 cases in
the U.S.
Diagnosis: The diagnosis is established with serology (EIA IgM) or RT-PCR for Hantavirus
during the first 10 days of illness.

Epidemiology: Rats and mice are hosts for Sin Nombre virus and transmit it by droppings,
saliva, and urine. In the U.S. there were 344 cases reported from 1992 to June 2003 from 31
states, primarily in June and July in the Four Corners area (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico,
and Utah) (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta.hantavirus.htm ). Other areas with HPS
are Argentina, Boliva, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The average
age was 37 years. Person-to-person with nosocomical spread was reported in Argentina
(Emerg Infect Dis 1997;3:171.).
Treatment: Supportive care. A trial with ribavirin was unsuccessful ( CID 2002;34:304.).
E. SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS)
1. Case definition: CDC 7/11/03 (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition)
a. Clinical Criteria
1. Asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness
2. Moderate respiratory illness
Temperature of >100.4°F (>38°C)*, and
One or more clinical findings of respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of
breath, difficulty breathing, or hypoxia).
3. Severe respiratory illness
Temperature of >100.4°F (>38°C)*, and
One or more clinical findings of respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of
breath, difficulty breathing, or hypoxia), radiographic evidence of pneumonia,
respiratory distress syndrome, or autopsy findings consistent with pneumonia
or respiratory distress syndrome without an identifiable cause.
b. Epidemiologic Criteria
1. Travel (including transit in an airport) within 10 days of onset of symptoms
P.201
to an area with current or previously documented or suspected community

transmission of SARS, or
2. Close contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms with a person known or
suspected to have SARS. The last date for illness onset is 10 days (i.e., one
incubation period) after removal of a CDC travel alert. The case patient's travel
should have occurred on or before the last date the travel alert was in place.
c. Laboratory Criteria
1. Confirmed
Detection of antibody to SARS-CoV in specimens obtained during acute illness
or >28 days after illness onset, or
Detection of SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR confirmed by a second PCR assay, by
using a second aliquot of the specimen and a different set of PCR primers, or
Isolation of SARS-CoV.
2. Negative
Absence of antibody to SARS-CoV in convalescent serum obtained >28 days
after symptom onset.
3. Undetermined
Labatory testing either not performed or incomplete.
d. Case Classification
1. Probable case: Meets the clinical criteria for severe respiratory illness of unknown
etiology and epidemiologic criteria for exposure; laboratory criteria confirmed,
negative, or undetermined.
2. Suspect case: Meets the clinical criteria for moderate respiratory illness of unknown
etiology, and epidemiologic criteria for exposure; laboratory criteria confirmed,
negative, or undetermined.
2. Diagnostic Evaluation

a. Chest x-ray
b. Pulse oximetry
c. Blood cultures
d. Sputum gram stain and culture
e. Tests for influenza and RSV
f. “Consider” urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae and Legionella
g. Acute and convalescent sera separated by >21 days for patients who meet definition of
SARS case sent to state or local health departments for testing at CDC
3. Prevention: Transmission occurs primarily by direct contact with infectious material including
large respiratory droplets; unlike TB, spread may also occur by direct contact with respiratory
secretions. The following recommendations are designed to prevent spread to health care
workers and to close contacts.
a. Precautions for hospitalized patients: This includes standard precautions (hand hygiene),
airborne precautions (N95 respirators), and contact precautions (gown and gloves).
b. Advice to close contacts: Be alert to detect fever or respiratory symtpoms. If symptoms
develop, avoid contact with others and seek medical attention.
c. Advice to travelers: Elective travel to epidemic areas should be avoided. If travel to
these areas is required, the traveler should carry a thermometer, household disinfectant,
surgical mask, and disposable alcohol-based hand rubs. It is also advised to check with
health insurance plans about medical care coverage.
d. Ambulatory care and emergency rooms: Screening should be done for possible cases
identified as the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms,
P.202
recent travel to endemic areas, and close contact with a suspected SARS patient.
e. Suspected cases should be evaluated in a separate area.
f. The suspected person with SARS should wear a surgical mask. Health care personnel

should wear an N95 respirator; if not available, a surgical mask should be worn.
F. WEST NILE VIRUS
West Nile Virus (WNV) Infection: Information for Clinicians [CDC
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/resources/fact_sheet_clinicians.htm ; accessed
7/26/03]: The following is a summary of WNV from the CDC website and other sources:
1. Clinical Features
a. Mild infection
1. About 80% are asymptomatic and 20% develop mild illness.
2. Incubation period is 3–14 days for those with clinical symptoms.
3. Symptoms usually last 3–6 days.
4. Clinical features are sudden onset of afebrile illness accompanied by malaise,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, eye pain, headache, myalgias, rash and/or
lymphadenopathy.
b. Severe infection
1. About 1 in 150 cases will cause severe neurologic disease, most commonly
encephalitis and less commonly, meningitis
2. The major factor for severe neurologic disease is advanced age.
3. Features of severe disease are fever, weakness, GI symptoms, and a change in
mental status; a minority develop a maculopapular or morbilliform rash involving the
neck, trunk, arms, or legs.
4. A small number of patients have developed severe muscle weakness and flaccid
paralysis or Parkinson's syndrome
5. Neurologic presentations include ataxia, cranial nerve abnormalities, myelitis, optic
neuritis, polyradiculitis, and seizures.
c. Clinical suspicion

This diagnosis should be suspected in adults over 50 years who develop unexplained
encephalitis or meningitis in summer or early fall, especially if there are local cases or
travel to an implicated area.
d. Neurologic complications
1. Viral encephalitis, characterized by:
Fever = 38°C or 100°F, and
CNS involvement, including altered mental status (altered level of
consciousness, confusion, agitation, or lethargy) or other cortical signs (cranial
nerve palsies, paresis or paralysis, or convulsions), and
An abnormal CSF profile suggesting a viral etiology (a negative bacterial stain
and culture with a mononuclear pleocytosis [WBC 5–1500 cells/mm 3 ] and/or
elevated protein level [>40 mg/dl]).
2. Aseptic meningitis (among persons aged 17 years and up), characterized by:
Fever = 38°C or 100°F, and
Headache, stiff neck and/or other meningeal signs, and
An abnormal CSF profile suggesting a viral etiology (a negative bacterial stain
and culture with a pleocytosis [WBC between 5 and 1500 cells/mm 3 ] and/or
elevated protein level [=40 mg/dl]).
3. Poliomyelitis-like syndromes: acute flaccid paralysis or paresis, (which may
resemble Guillain-Barré syndrome), or other unexplained movement disorders such
as tremor, myoclonus or Parkinson's-like symptoms,
P.203
especially if associated with atypical features, such as fever, altered mental status,
and/or a pleocytosis. Afebrile patients with asymmetric weakness, with or without
areflexia, have also been reported in association with West Nile virus.
2. Diagnosis

1. The most efficient method is detection of IgM in serum which is usually positive at the
time of viral clearance and at the onset of neurologic disease.
2. False positive test may be a problem in patients recently vaccinated against or recently
infected with related flaviviruses including yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, or
dengue.
a. Laboratory findings
Total leukocyte counts are normal or elevated with lymphopenia and anemia.
Some have hyponatremia.
CSF shows pleocytosis with predominance of lymphocytes, protein is universally
elevated and glucose is normal.
CT scans of the brain are usually normal, but about one third have MRI
demonstrated enhancement of the leptomeninges, the periventricular areas of
both.
3. Treatment: The usual treatment is supportive. There is an NIH-sponsored trial with
hyperimmune globulin, which should be started early.

GUIDELINES FOR USE OF ANTIMICROBIAL
AGENTS IN NEUTROPENIC PATIENTS WITH
UNEXPLAINED FEVER
(Infectious Disease Society of America, CID 2002;34:730.; reprinted with
permission)
P.208
Definition: Fever is defined as a single oral temp of 38.3°C × 1 or
38.0°C for over one hour. Neutropenia is defined as an ANC
<500/mm 3 or <1000/mm 3 with a predicted decrease to <500/mm 3 .
Evaluation for vancomycin need:
1. suspected catheter-related infection,
2. known colonization with beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae or
MRSA,
3. positive blood cultures for GP bacteria prior to identification, or
4. hypotension.
Assessment for possible oral antibiotic treatment: Patients at low risk
for complications may often be treated with oral antibiotics if there is
no focus of infection and lack of findings for systemic infection such
as rigors or hypotension. If outpatient treatment is to be used, there
must be access to medical care 24/7.

Risk assessment: Factors supporting low risk are an ANC exceeding
100/mm 3 , absolute monocyte count exceeding 100/mm 3 , normal chest
x-ray, nearly normal renal and hepatic tests, neutropenia less than 7
days, malignancy in remission, temperature peak less than 39°C,
early evidence of marrow recovery, and none of the following: IV
catheter site infection, neurologic or mental status changes,
appearance of illness, abdominal pain or cormorbidity/complications.
Antibiotic selection (Figure 1)

FIGURE 1: GUIDE TO INITIAL MANAGEMENT

1. Low risk, oral treatment: Ciprofloxacin plus
amoxicillin-clavulanate.
2. Low risk, IV therapy: Cefepime, ceftazidime, or carbapenem
3. High risk with no need for vancomycin: Monotherapy (see Figure
1) or dual therapy: aminoglycoside plus either an
antipseudomonal penicillin, cefepime, ceftazidime, or
carbapenem.
4. High risk and vancomycin needed: Vancomycin plus cefepime,

ceftazidime, or carbapenem plus/minus aminoglycoside.
P.209
Modifications of therapy based on response at 3–5 days (Figures 2 and
3)

Figure 2: Management of patients who become afebrile in first
3–5 days of initial antibiotic therapy.

Figure 3: Treatment of patients who have persistent fever after
3–5 days of treatment and for whom the etiology of the fever is
not found.

1. Response and pathogen defined: Adjust therapy based on
pathogen.
2. Response and no pathogen identified: Oral therapy should be
continued. IV therapy may be changed to oral ciprofloxacin plus
amoxicillin-clavulanate after 48 hours
3. Persistent fever at 3 days and no change in patient condition:
Continue same antibiotics, but consider discontinuing vancomycin
if there is no clear need for it.
4. Persistent fever at 3–5 days and progressive disease: Change
antibiotic regimen depending on the initial regimen. This includes
the addition of vancomycin if it was not initially used and there
are criteria for it, or consideration of discontinuing vancomycin if
it was included in the initial regimen.
5. Persistent fever at days 5–7: Consider antifungal agent such as
amphotericin B, lipid amphotericin B (no more effective, but
reduced toxicity), or fluconazole. Fluconazole is acceptable at an

institution where Aspergillus and azole-resistant Candida
infections are uncommon, where fluconazole was not used as
prophylaxis, and when there is no evidence of pulmonary disease
or sinusitis. Recent reviews have not shown clear advantages in
efficacy for empiric use of amphotericin B, lipid amphotericin,
itraconazole, or fluconazole.
Antibiotic discontinuation (Figure 4): Low risk patients may have
antibiotics discontinued when they are afebrile 5–7 days. If the ANC
increases above 500/mL, stop antibiotics at 4–5 days. If there is
persistent fever at day 3 and persistent ANC <500/mm 3 , continue
antibiotics for 2 weeks and reasses.

FIGURE 4: DURATION OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY

P.210

Miscellaneous issues
Antiviral drugs: Not recommended unless there is laboratory or
clinical support for use.

Granulocyte transfusions: Not recommended.
G-CSF or GM-CSF: Not recommended for routine use, but may be
considered if there is an expected long delay in marrow recovery and
those with documented infections who do not respond to antibiotics.
Prophylaxis in neutropenic patients without fever: TMP-SMX is
sometimes recommended for PCP regardless of neutropenia. There are
good data supporting efficacy of prophylaxis with TMP-SMX,
quinolones, fluconazole, and itraconazole for reducing the number of
infectious complications of neutropenia, but the Panel recommends
against this prophylaxis due to the concerns for antibiotic resistance
and the failure of these studies to show reduction in mortality.

Proposed Case Definition for the Streptococcal Toxic Shock
Syndrome*

I. Isolation of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes)
A. From a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal,
pleural, or peritoneal fluid, tissue biopsy, surgical
wound)
B. From a nonsterile site (e.g., throat, sputum, vagina,
superficial skin lesion)
II. Clinical signs of severity
A. Hypotension: Systolic blood pressure . 90 mmHg in
adults or <5th percentile for age in children and
B. 22 of the following signs
1. Renal impairment: creatinine 2177 6mol/L (22
mg/dL) for adults or greater than or equal to twice
the upper limit of normal for age. In patients with
preexisting renal disease, a 22-fold elevation over
the baseline level
2. Coagulopathy: platelets .100 × 10°/L
(.100,000/mm 3 ) or disseminated intravascular
coagulation defined by prolonged clotting times, low
fibrinogen level, and the presence of fibrin
degradation products
3. Liver involvement: alanine amino-transferase

(SGOT), asparate amino-transferase (SGPT), or total
bilirubin levels greater than or equal to twice the
upper limit of normal for age. In patients with
preexisting liver disease a 22-fold elevation over
the baseline level
4. Adult respiratory distress syndrome defined by
acute onset of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and
hypoxemia in the absence of cardiac failure, or
evidence of diffuse capillary leak manifested by
acute onset of generalized edema, or pleural or
peritoneal effusions with hypoalbuminemia
5. A generalized erythematous macular rash that may
desquamate
6. Soft-tissue necrosis, including necrotizing fasciitis or
myositis, or gangrene

* An illness fulfilling criteria IA and IIA and IIB can be defined as a
definite case. An illness fulfilling criteria IB and IIA and IIB can be
defined as a probable case if no other etiology for the illness is
identified.

Therapy of Streptococcal Infections of Skin and Soft Tissue
(NEJM 1996;334:240.; AAC 2003;423:104.)

1. Antibiotic: S. pyogenes is exquisitely sensitive to
beta-lactams; penicillin is preferred for pharyngitis,
erysipelas, impetigo, and cellulitis. Experimental models of
fulminant infections show clindamycin is superior, presumably
because it inhibits protein synthesis and activity is
independent of inoculum size. Clindamycin or clindamycin plus
penicillin is preferred for necrotizing fasciitis, myositis,
empyema, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Studies in
the mouse myositis model show clindaymcin is superior to
penicillin for inhibiting streptococcal toxin production in vivo;
penicillin combined with clindamycin showed no antagonism

(AAC 1987;31:213; AAC 2003;423;104)
2. IVIG: Anecdotal studies support use for streptococcal toxic
shock syndrome at suggested dose of 1g/kg day 1 then
0.5g/kg on days 2 and 3 (CID 2003;37:333)
3. Surgery: Prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement
of deep-seated infections are important

C. Major conditions within categories in most cont emporary reviews ( Arch Intern Med 2003;16:1033. )
1. Infection: Endocarditis, TB, U TI, and intra-abdominal abscess
2. Malignancy (“omas”): Hematologic, solid tumor with hepatic mets
3. Connective tissue: Still disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, and granulomat ous disease (sarcoid, Crohn
disease, granulomatous hepatitis, and t emporal arteritis)
4. Miscellaneous: Pulmonary emboli, drug fever, periodic fever, and “habitual hyperthermia”
5. No diagnosis: Long-term follow-up in 80 cases showed no late sequelae ( Arch Intern Med 2003;163:1033. )
D. Diagnostic tests (Arch Intern Med 2003;163;545. )
Step 1: Confirm fever (daily temps)
Fever patt ern: not helpful (Arch Intern Med 1979;139:1225. )
Stop meds: Fever resolves <72 hrs or there is anot her cause ( Inf Dis Clin N Amer 1996;10:85. )
Step 2: Select ed t ests
CT abdomen: Cause found in 19% ( Radiology 1980;136:407. ) Repeat scan is not helpful
Nuclar scans: Variable
Endocarditis: Duke criteria-sensit ivity 82% ( CID 1995;21:905. )
Liver biopsy: Y ield is 14–17% ( Arch Int ern Med 1977;137:1001. ; J Clin Gastro 1993;17:29. ) (but
usually with abnormal LFTs)
Temporal artery bx: 16% ( J Am Gastric Soc 1993;41:1187. ) (in age >50 yrs)
Leg doppler: 2–6% (Int ern Med 1994;33:67. )
Tests that are usually not helpful: Ultrasound, bone scan, MRI, D-dimer assay, ESR , and CRP
E. Fever evaluation in critically ill patients Recommendat ions of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the
ISDA (Clin Infect Dis 1998;26:1042. )
Blood culture : Two blood cultures (with 10–15 mL each) from separate sites drawn 510 minutes apart. For
skin preparation, povidine iodine (10%) should be allowed to dry 2 minutes and t incture of iodine (1–2%)
should be allowed to dry 30 seconds. Alcohol with no drying time is an alternative. With an intravenous
cat heter, one peripheral vein sample and one through the catheter is an alternative to 2 peripheral vein
samples, but the results provide less precise information.
Intravascular catheters : T he risk of fever with central venous cat het ers is 5–10 per 1000 catheter days
and for peripheral IV catheters the risk is <0.2 per 1000 catheter days. If there is evidence of tunnel
infection, emboli events, vascular compromise, or sepsis the cat heter should be removed.
Pulmonary infection : The evaluation should include a chest x-ray, Gram stain, and culture of respiratory
secretions and pleural fluid evaluat ion (if present)
P.216
C. difficile : If 52 loose or watery stools/day there should be one stool sample sent for C. difficile t oxin
assay. If this is negative a second specimen can be sent. If disease is severe and the toxin test is
negat ive or delayed, it is appropriate to treat empirically with metronidazole.
Sinusitis: If clinical findings support t his diagnosis, there should be a CT scan. With evidence of sinusitis

on CT scan there should be puncture or aspiration of sinuses under sterile conditions for Gram stain and
culture for aerobes, anerobes, and fungi.
Urinary tract infection : Urine should be evaluated by quantitative culture for PMNs. Pyuria should be
tested by esterase dipstick and Gram st ain of centrifuged urine sediment. Urine should be collect ed from
the urine port of a Foley cathet er; UTIs almost always show >10 4 cfu/mL and pyuria with a catheter
collection. If the delay in culture of collected urine >1 hr it should be refrigerated or placed in a
preservative.
Postop fever : Noninfectious fever is common during the first 48 hrs. post-operative. Unexplained fever
>72 hrs post-operat ive should be evaluated with chest x-ray, urine culture and urinanalysis, and exam for
phlebitis, thrombosis, pulmonary emoblism, and wound infection.
Fever due to non-infectious causes : Blood products (especially RBC's & platelets), drugs, pancreat it is,
myocardial infarction, pulmonary emboli, and chemical phlebitis.

Treatment of Lyme Disease and
Potential Exposures
(Recommendations of Med Letter 2000;42:37.; MMWR 1997;46:532.; Ann
Intern Med 1998;128:37.)
Prevention: (NEJM 2003;348:2424.):
1. The vaccine (LYMErix has been withdrawn from the market due to
poor sales (Nat Med 2002;8:311.).
2. Removal of I. scapularis ticks within 36 hrs of attachment using
daily tick checks (regarded as most effective preventive strategy)
(JID 1997;175:996.; NEJM 2001;345:79.; Am J Epidemiol
1998;147;391.).
3. Prophylactic doxycycline for tick bites (see below).
4. Tick control with acaricide (cardaryl, cyfluthrin, or deltamethrin)
in early May reduces I. scapularis nymph population by 68–100%
(J Med Entomol 2001;38:344.).
5. Note that treatment of early Lyme disease (erythema migrans
stage) prevents late sequelae in >95% (Ann Intern Med
1983;99:22.; AAC 1995;39:661.; Am J Med 1992;92:396.; Ann
Intern Med 1996;124:785.; NEJM 1997;337:289.; Ann Intern
Med 2002;136:421.)
Tick bite: Prophylactic doxycycline 200 mg po × 1 reduces the risk of
Lyme disease if given within 72 hours of a bite from a I. scapularis
tick vector especially in a high incidence area, and with bites from
nymphal ticks that are partially engorged (NEJM 2001; 344:79).
Efficacy is 87%. GI intolerance to doxycycline dose is improved if
taken with meal
Epidemiology: In 2000 there were 17,730 cases of Lyme disease

reported in the U.S. The number of cases/incidence per 100,000
population by state: CT—3,773/110.8; RI—675/64.4, NJ—2,459/29.2;
NY—4,329/22.8; DE—167/21.3, PA—2,343/19.2; MA—1,158/18.2,
MD—688/13.0, and WI—631/11.8. The total cases reported for
1991–2000 was 132,438 and the incidence for the U.S. in 2000 was
6.3/100,000 (MMWR 2002; 51:29)
Diagnosis: Recommendations of American College of Physicians (Ann
Intern Med 1997;127:110.)
Clinical diagnosis: Patients from an endemic Lyme disease area
who present with erythema migrans do not require laboratory
confirmation. Seroconversion occurs in 27% with symptoms <7
days, 41% with symptoms 7–14 days and 88% with symptoms
>14 days (Ann Intern Med 2002;136:421.). Confirmation of late
Lyme disease requires objective evidence of Lyme disease plus
laboratory evidence
Culture: Erythema migrans—saline lavage needle aspiration or 2
mm punch biopsy
P.217
of the leading edge show B. burgderfori by culture or PCR in
60–80% (Ann Intern Med 2002;136:421.)
Serology (MMWR 1999;48 RR–7.; JAMA 1999;282:62.): ELISA
testing is standard—sensitivity = 89% and specificity = 72%;
when ELISA results are positive or indeterminant, use a Western
blot. A positive Western blot confirms the diagnosis and a
negative Western blot greatly decreases the probability of Lyme
so that treatment is not indicated.
Phases:
Erythema migrans
Early disseminated Lyme disease with carditis and
neurologic features including lymphocytic meningitis and
radiculoneuropathies
Late Lyme disease with peripheral neuropathies, chronic
encephalopathy, or arthritis with migratory polyarthritis
and/or monoarthritis. The term “chronic Lyme disease” (in
reference to debilitating fatigue) was first applied in 1985
and has no objective findings, but there is considerable
support from Internet site advocacy groups and some
physicians (Ann Intern Med 2002;136:413.). Multiple studies
indicate no evidence of Lyme disease and no benefit from

empiric treatment even with long courses of IV antibiotics
(NEJM 2001;345:85.; Ann Intern Med 1998;128:354.; JID
1995;171:356.; JID 1995;171:423.; CID 2000;31:1107.)

a

Antibiotics often given parenterally × 2 wk, then orally × 4 wk.

b

Debridement requires removal of necrotic bone; dead space created may be filled
with cancellous bone grafts or tissue flaps or antibiotic impregnated beads. Beads are
usually replaced by bone grafts at 2–4 wk.

Empiric treatment:
1. Infected prosthetic material: Vancomycin
2. Hemoglopathy: Nafcillin/oxacillin + ampicillin
3. Vascular insufficiency, diabetic foot ulcer, decubitus ulcer: Ciprofloxacin +
clindamycin (po or lV), ciprofloxacin + metronidazole (po or lV), imipenem,
piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, gatifloxacin (po)
4. Human bite: Ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone
B. Diagnosis: Surgical sampling or needle biopsy is preferred. Swabs of fistula tracts or ulcers
are less reliable (JAMA 239:2772, 1978) The preferred nuclear imaging method is
technetium-99 (sensitivity 70–100%; specificity 20–80%). Favored scans CT and MRI
(sensitivity 30–100%; specificity 80–90%; best test with diabetic foot or decubitus ulcer:
Probe wound for bone, sensitivity 66%, specificity 85% (see JAMA 273: 721, 1995)

Duration of antibiotic treatment is 2–4 wk; the exception is gonococcal septic

P.227
4. Other therapy:
a. Drainage: Joint aspiration usually advocated (NEJM 312:764, 1985); repeat needle
aspiration at 5–7 days often beneficial. Persistence of effusion >7 days is indication
for surgical drainage (CID 20:225, 1995)
b. Weight bearing: Avoid until inflammation resolves
c. Passive range of motion first week, active ROM at 1–2 wk
d. Controversies: Duration of antibiotics; oral vs parenteral route of antibiotics;
splinting vs passive ROM; optimal drainage—aspiration, open drainage, or
arthroscopy
5. Prosthetic joint

a. Bacteriology: S. aureus (20–30%), S. epidermidis (20–30%), streptococci
(15–25%), Gram-negative bacilli (15–25%), anaerobes (5–10%)
b. Classification:
1. Acute contiguous within 6 mo of surgery: Presumably reflects contamination at
time of surgery;
2. chronic contiguous at 6–24 mo after surgery: Presumably also because of
contamination at the time of surgery;
3. hematogenous at L2 yr after surgery
c. Diagnosis: A common presentation is loosening that could be septic but is most
commonly mechanical (Curr Opinion 2:2000, 2000). Overlying inflammation or
drainage facilitates the distinction. When this is not present diagnostic tests include
ESR, C reactive protein, imaging (x-ray, bone scan, MRI, CT scan) and/or joint
aspiration. None of these are considered consistently reliable—the best method is
biopsy at surgery showing inflammation and culture (Curr Opinion 2:2000,2000)
d. Management
Single stage revision: Remove all foreign and necrotic material, replace
prosthesis with antibiotic impregnated cement, and give antibiotics × 6 wk.
Success rate is 20–30%. Relative contraindications: Resistant bacteria,
especially Candida, GNB, enterococci
Two stage revision (usually preferred): Remove all foreign and necrotic
material, give IV antibiotics 6 wk, then replace prosthesis using
antibiotic-impregnated spacer. Success rate: 70–80%
Resection arthroplasty: Removal of all foreign and necrotic material and fuse
joint. Indication is contraindication or refusal for replacement of prosthesis
Medical management: Debridement cultures and antibiotics. Antibiotics are
primarily oral and given L6 mo to lifelong. This is advocated only when patient
is an extremely poor surgical candidate or refuses preferred procedures

e. Antibiotics: Selection is based on culture and in vitro sensitivity tests. Favored
drugs for S. epidermidis—vancomycin; S. aureus—nafcillin, oxacillin, cefazolin,
vancomycin; GNB—fluoroquinolones, betalactams.
P.228
Duration is 4–8 wk, usually 6 wk. Role of antibiotic-impregnated polymethyl
metuacrylate “cement” (tobramycin and vancomycin) is unclear (Am J Orthop
27:201, 1998; Clin Orthop 295:96,1993).
B. Chronic Monarticular Arthritis
1. Bacteria: Brucella, Nocardia
2. Mycobacteria: M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. avium-intracellulare, M.
fortuitum (see pp 166–176).
3. Fungi: Sporothrix schenckii (soil contact), Coccidioides immitis (endemic area,
non-Caucasian immunocompromised men), Blastomyces dermatitidis (endemic area),
Candida sp (intraarticular steroids or systemic candidiasis), Pseudallescheria boydii
(penetrating trauma), Scedosporium (penetrating trauma) (see pp 151–164).
C. Polyarticular Arthritis
1. Bacteria: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (usually accompanied by skin lesions, positive cultures
of blood and/or genital tract, negative joint cultures); N. meningitidis; Borrelia
burgdorferi (Lyme disease, see pp 213–214); pyogenic (10% of cases of septic arthritis
have two or more joints involved).
2. Viral: Hepatitis B (positive serum HBsAg, seen in pre-icteric phase, ascribed to
immune-complexes often in association with urticaria, symmetric arthritis involving hands
most frequently, then knees and ankles); rubella (usually small joints of hand, women
more than men, simultaneous rash, and tenosynovitis also seen with rubella vaccine in up
to 40% of susceptible postpubertal women); Parvovirus B 19 (symmetric arthritis
involving hands/wrists and/or knees; adults more than children; women more than men);
mumps (0.5% of mumps cases, large and small joints, accompanies parotitis, men more
than women); lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (adults with aseptic meningitis);

arthropod-borne alpha virus: Chikungunya (East Africa, India), O'nyong-nyong (East
Africa), Ockelbo agent (Sweden), Ross River agent (Australia), Barmah Forest virus
(Australia).
3. Miscellaneous: Acute rheumatic fever (Jones' criteria including evidence of preceding
streptococcal infection); Reiter's syndrome (conjunctivitis and urethritis, associated
infections—Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia).

Infections of Central Nervous System
I. Cerebrospinal Fluid
A. Normal Findings
1. Opening pressure: 5–15 mmHg or 65–195 mmH 2 O
2. Leukocyte count: <10 mononuclear cells/mm 3 (5–10/mL suspect); 1 PMN (5%)
Bloody tap: Usually 1 WBC/700 RBC with normal peripheral RBC and WBC counts; if
abnormal: true CSF WBC = WBC (CSF) - WBC (blood) × RBC (CSF)/RBC (blood)
Note: WBCs begin to disintegrate after 90 min
3. Protein: 15–45 mg/dL (higher in elderly)
Formula: 23.8 × 0.39 × age + 15 mg/100 mL or (more simply) less than patient's age
(>35 yr)
Traumatic tap: 1 mg/1000 RBCs
4. Glucose: 40–80 mg% of CSF/blood glucose ratio >0.6 (with high serum glucose, usual
ratio is 0.3)
B. Abnormal CSF with Noninfectious Causes
1. Traumatic tap: Increased protein; RBCs; WBC count and differential proportionate to
RBCs in peripheral blood; clear and colorless supernatant of centrifuged CSF.

2. Chemical meningitis (injection of anesthetics, chemotherapeutic agents, air,
radiographic dyes): Increased protein, lymphocytes (occasionally PMNs).
3. Cerebral contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral bleed: RBCs,
increased protein (1 mg/1000 RBCs), disproportionately increased PMNs (peak at 72–96
hr), decreased glucose (in 15–20%).
4. Vasculitis (SLE, etc): Increased protein (50–100 mg/dL), increased WBCs (usually
mononuclear cells, occasionally PMNs), normal glucose.
5. Postictal (repeated generalized seizures): RBCs (0–500/mm 3 ), WBCs (10–100/mm 3
with variable percentage PMNs with peak at 1 day), protein normal or slight increase.
6. Tumors (especially glioblastomas, leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, pancreatic
cancer): Low glucose, increased protein, moderate PMNs.
7. Neurosurgery: Blood; increased protein; WBCs (disproportionate to RBCs with
predominance of mononuclear cells) up to 2 wk post-op.
8. Sarcoidosis: Increased protein; WBCs (up to 100/mm 3 predominately mononuclear
cells); low glucose in 10%.
C. CSF with Pyogenic Meningitis (NEJM 1993;328:21.; Lancet 1995;346:1675.)
1. Findings: Opening pressure >300 mmH 2 O - 40%; WBC > 100/mm 3 - 90%; % PMNs >
20%–98%, most >80%; 80%; protein > 45 mg/dL - 96%; glucose < 40 mg/dL - 50%;
Gram stain pos - 60%, culture positive 73%.
2. Etiologic diagnosis: Sensitivity of Gram stain 60–80%; antigen assays most helpful in
patients with prior antibiotic treatment (Pediatr Emerg Care 1994; 10:67.).
3. Predictors of bacterial meningitis: Glucose <34 mg/dL, CSF/serum glucose ratio
<0.23, protein >220 mg/dL, WBC >2000 mg/dL or 1180 neutrophils/dL each predict
bacterial meningitis with 99% certainty (JAMA 1989;262:2700.).
4. Response: CSF cultures should become sterile within 24–36 hr of appropriate therapy
(Pediatr Infect Dis J 1992;11:423.).

D. Practical Issues in Management
1. Need for scan prior to LP: Review of 301 adult cases of suspected pyogenic meningitis
showed evidence that pre-LP scans delayed antibiotic admin
P.234
istration by an average of 2 hrs, and showed mass effect in only 2% ( NEJM
2001;345:1727.). The recommendation was to do the LP with a #22 or #25 needle to
minimize risk and restrict pre-LP CT scans to those likely to have an intracranial mass or
elevated CSF pressure as indicated by immunosuppression, dilated or poorly reactive
pupils, papilledema, ocular palsy, hemiparesis, recent history of seizures, rapid decrease
in consciousness, bradycardia, irregular respirations, tonic seizures, or decrebrate or
decorticate posture (NEJM 2001;345:1768.; Arch Dis Child 1992;67:1417.)
2. Dexamethasone in adults with pyogenic meningitis: Controlled trial showed
significant benefit with dexamethasone 10 mg given 15–20 min before first dose of
antibiotics and repeated q6h × 4 days. The dexamethasone recipients showed a superior
outcome with reduced mortiliaty (11/157 [7%] vs 21/144 [15%]) in placebo recipients

Ceftizoxime: 9 g/d in three doses
Ceftriaxone: 2–4 g/d in two doses
Ceftazidime: 6–12 g/d in three doses
Chloramphenicol: 4–6 g/d in four doses
Penicillins: Ampicillin: 12 g/d in six doses
Ticarcillin: 18–24 g/d in six doses
Mezlocillin: 18–24 g/d in six doses
Piperacillin: 18–24 g/d in six doses
Nafcillin: 9–12 g/d in six doses

Aztreonam: 6 g/d in four doses
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: 15–20 mg/kg/d (trimethoprim) in four doses
Metronidazole: 2 g/d in two to four doses
Vancomycin: 2 g/d in two doses

Intrathecal/intraventricular doses:

E. Meningitis: Empiric treatment (adapted from Med Lett 1999;41:95.; NEJM 1996;334:54.)
1. Adults—immunocompetent
Cephalosporin: Cefotaxime 2 g q4h IV or ceftriaxone 2 g q12h IV plus vancomycin 1 g IV
q12h ± rifampin 300 mg po or IV bid.
Note: If isolate is susceptible to cephalosporins, discontinue vancomycin and rifampin.
2. L. monocytogenes: Ampicillin 2 g q4h IV ± aminoglycoside plus cefotaxime or ceftriaxone
+ vancomycin
3. Penicillin allergy: Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus vancomycin ± rifampin. If
cephalosporins contraindicated then chloramphenicol plus vancomycin ± rifampin. For
Gram-negative bacilli then aztreonam. For Listeria then TMP-SMX
4. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy: Dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV q6h × 4 days) has
significant benefit in multiple studies in children for reduction of neurologic sequelae,
especially hearing loss (NEJM 1991;324:1525.; Pediatr Infect Dis J 1995;14:490.). One
study showed a reduction in mortality rates in adults (Pediatr Infect Dis J 1989;8:848.).
A. Tunkel and M. Scheld recommend adjunctive dexamethasone for high-risk adult
patients: Impaired mental status, cerebral edema, or very high intracranial pressure
(Lancet 1995;346:1675.). Dexamethasone reduces vancomycin levels in CSF so rifampin
should be added for suspected or established pneumococcal meningitis pending in vitro
sensitivity tests (AAC 1995;39:2171.).
Note: Dexamethasone should be given about 30 min before first dose of antibiotics (NEJM
1991;324:1525.).

RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS: Recommendations of two panels—one representing the CDC
and the other representing the American College of Physicians/American Society of Internal
Medicine. Both groups published their recommendations in the same issue of Annals of Internal
Medicine. They covered the same infections (pharyngitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and viral URIs).
Panel membership overlapped between the two groups, and both said essentially the same thing.

* Centor criteria (Med Decis Making 1981;1:239): 1) Tonsillar exudates, 2) cervical

assay-antibiotic (penicillin) for positives; 3–4: empiric penicillin. Note: The IDSA
guidelines for managing pharyngitis do not accept centor criteria as adequate because of a
high rate of false positives using clinical criteria (CID 2002;35:113). These guidelines call
for evidence of Group A streptococci by culture or rapid antigen detection test. This
approach requiring pathogen detection appears to be the most cost effective strategy (Ann

B. Empiric Treatment of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections
1. Community-acquired pneumonia: Guidelines of Infectious Diseases Society of America (modified from
CID 2003;37:405.)
Outpatient
Generally preferred: Macrolide*, telithromycin,† fluoroquinolone **, or doxycycline
Modifying factors
Suspected penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: Fluoroquinolone **, telithromycin†
Suspected aspiration: Amoxicillin-clavulanate
Hospitalized Patient
General medical ward

Generally preferred: Beta-lactam*** + macrolide * or fluoroquinolone ** (alone)
Hospitalized in the intensive care unit for serious pneumonia
Generally preferred: Erythromycin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolone ** plus cefotaxime or
ceftriaxone
Modifying factors
Structural disease of lung: Antipseudomonal penicillin, carbapenem, or cefepime + macrolide or
fluoroquinolone ** + aminoglycoside
Penicillin allergy: fluoroquinolone ** + clindamycin
Suspected aspiration: fluoroquinolone + clindamycin or beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor
(alone)
2. Nosocomial pneumonia
a. Etiologic diagnosis: Diagnosis of pneumonia based on clinical criteria of fever, x-ray evidence of an
infiltrate, and purulent respiratory secretions is often erroneous based on quantitative brush catheters of
bronchoscopic aspirates (Ann Intern Med 2000;132:621.). The debate with ventilator associated pneumonia
is empiric treatment vs quantitative bronchoscopic specimens ( Lancet 2000;356:874.).
b. Empiric treatment (Med Letter 1999;41:95.)
Third generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, or ceftazidime), cefepime,
ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, or imipenem
With or without aminoglycoside (tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin)
Special considerations
Probable P. aeruginosa (especially ICU): Cefepime, meropenem, or imipenem plus aminoglycoside
Probable S. aureus: Add vancomycin
3. Lung abcess
a. Anaerobic bacteria (recommendations of IDSA, CID 2000;31:347.)
1. Clindamycin
2. Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor
3. Imipinem/meropenem/ertapenem
P.252

b. Other microbial pathogen—see next section
4. Acute bronchitis (Recommendations of ACP and CDC: Ann Intern Med 2001; 134:479 and 521)
Evaluation of acute cough should focus on ruling out pneumonia
Chest x-ray if:
1. Abnormal vital signs,
2. “asymetrical lung sounds,” or
3. cough >3 wks
Antibiotics are not recommended regardless of duration of cough. Most are viral and self-limited
Treatment is symptomatic with antipyretics, analgesics, beta-agonist inhalers, antitussives, or vaporizers
Influenza: Amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir (must start within 48 hr of onset of flu
symptoms)
Pertussis: Erythromycin 500 mg po qid × 14 days or TMP-SMX DS bid × 14 days Antibacterial agents have
no documented benefit and should be avoided except with suspected or established pertussis ( Am J Med
1999;107:62.)
5. Exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (Recommendations of ACP: Ann Intern Med 2001;134:600.)
a. Chest x-ray: Useful in hospitalized patients (up to 23% show new findings) and it may be useful in EW
visits; there are not data for or against its use in office practice
b. Treatment—hospitalized patients
Inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilators or short-acting beta 2 -agonists; anticholinergics are used first
and to maximum dose because of fewer side effects
Systemic steroids for up to 2 weeks
Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation supervised by trained physician
Cautious administration of O 2 to hypoxemic patients
c. Antibiotic decision-making
Reserve antibiotics for severe exacerbations
If used, the preference is narrow-spectrum agents. Prior placebo-controlled trials favored amoxicillin,
TMP-SMX, and tetracycline but they were done prior to emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria and
excluded nursing home patients and recent hospital discharges

Interventions without documented benefit: mucolytic therapy, chest physiotherapy, and methylxanthine
bronchodilators (the latter two may be harmful)

Endocarditis
I. DUKE CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS OF INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (Am J Med 1994;96:200.;
CID 2000;30:633.)
Note: The Duke criteria have become generally accepted (Am J Med 1994;96:200.) and multiple
reviews show a specificity of 99% and a negative predictive value of 92% (Am Heart J
1994;128:1200.; CID 1998;26:1302.).
A. Definite Infective Endocarditis
1. Pathologic criteria
Microorganisms: Demonstrated by culture or histology in a vegetation, or in a
vegetation that has embolized, or in an intracardiac abscess, or
Pathologic lesions: Vegetation or intracardiac abscess present, confirmed by
histology showing active endocarditis
2. Clinical criteria (using specific definitions listed below under “Definitions of
Terminology”)
Two major criteria, or one major and three minor criteria, or five minor criteria
B. Possible Infective Endocarditis 1 major + 1 minor or 3 minor
C. Rejected
1. Firm alternate diagnosis for manifestations of endocarditis, or

2. Resolution of manifestations of endocarditis with antibiotic therapy for 4 days or less, or

P.258
C. Echocardiography
Transthoracic echo is inadequate in up to 20% of adults due to obesity, chronic lung disease,
and chest wall deformities. The sensitivity for vegetations is 60–70% (J Am Coll Cardiol
1991;18:391.; Am J Med 1996;100:90.). Transesophageal echo increases sensitivity for
detecting vegetations to 75–95% and shows specificity of 85–98% (Am J Med
1999;107:198.). Guidelines for use (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997;29:862.) suggest the preference
for transthoracic echo to evaluate native valves in patients who are good candidates for
imaging, especially if the probability of endocarditis is less than 4%. For patients with a
probability of 4–60%, initial use of transesophageal echo is more cost-effective. TEE is more
sensitive for evaluating periovascular extension in myocardial abscesses.
S. aureus bacteremia: Endocarditis is found in 13–25% (CID 2002;30:633.). TEE is useful in
determining the duration of therapy in patients with uncomplicated,
intravascular-catheter-associated S. aureus bacteremia (Am J Med 1999;107:198.; Ann Intern
Med 1999;130:810.; CID 1999;28:106.).
D. Endocarditis risk/100,000 person years*
Native valve: 1.7–6.2
Prosthetic valve: 60 months: 2,000–3,000
Injection drug use: 700
III. TREATMENT OF ENDOCARDITIS
A. Medical Management by Microbial Pathogen (Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis

and Kawasaki Disease of the American Heart Association's Council on Cardiovascular Disease
in the Young: Antimicrobial Treatment of Infective Endocarditis due to Viridans Streptococci,
Enterococci, and Staphylococci. JAMA 274:1706, 1995)
1. Streptococci
a. Penicillin-sensitive streptococci (minimum inhibitory concentration <0.1 Pg/mL)
1. Penicillin only: Aqueous penicillin G, 12–18 mil units/day either continuously
or in 6 equally divided doses × 4 wk.
(Preferred regimen for patients with a relative contraindication to streptomycin
including age >65 yr, renal impairment, or prior 8th cranial nerve damage.)
2. Ceftriaxone: 2 g once daily IV × 4 wk
3. Two-week course: Aqueous penicillin G 12–18 mil units either continuously or in
6 equally divided doses plus gentamicin 1 mg/kg IM or IV q8h. Peak gentamicin
level (1 hr after start of 20- to 30-min infusion) should be 3 Pg/mL; trough
should be <1 Pg/mL. Two-week regimen is not recommended for complicated
cases, e.g., extracardiac foci or intracardiac abscesses. Aqueous penicillin G,
q12h. (Advocated as most cost-effective regimen by Mayo Clinic group for
uncomplicated cases with relapse rates of <1%.)
4. Penicillin allergy: Vancomycin, 30 mg/kg/d IV × 4 wk in 2–4 doses not to
exceed 2 g/d unless serum levels are monitored. Vancomycin levels 1 hr post
dosing should be 30–45 Pg/mL with twice daily dosing. Infuse vancomycin over
I60 min.
Note:
Streptococcus bovis and tolerant streptococci with MIC <0.1 Pg/mL may receive
any of these regimens
Nutritionally deficient should be treated as enterococcal endocarditis
Prosthetic valve endocarditis: IV penicillin for 6 wk and gentamicin for at least
2 wk

P.259
Immediate reaction to penicillin or other beta-lactam is major indication for
vancomycin
Penicillin tolerant strains with MBCs that greatly exceed MICs (>32-fold):
Recommend usual therapy, meaning routine MBC determination is not
recommended for streptococci
Gentamicin is now the most frequently used aminoglycoside because of ability
to monitor levels and ability to give IV or IM. If streptomycin is preferred, test
for high-level resistance (I1000 Pg/mL)
Two-week treatment regimen is not recommended for complicated cases, e.g.,
shock, extracardiac foci of infection, or intracardiac abscess
Desired peak serum levels if obtained: Streptomycin—20 Pg/mL, gentamicin—3
Pg/mL, vancomycin—20–35 Pg/mL (qid), or 30–45 Pg/mL (bid)
Ceftriaxone plus gentamicin once daily × 2 wk may be adequate
Expected bacteriologic cure rate: >95%; expected survival rate: >90%
b. Viridans streptococci and Streptococcus bovis relatively resistant to
penicillin G (minimum inhibitory concentration I0.1 Pg/mL and T0.5 Pg/mL)
1. Aqueous penicillin G, 18 mil units/d IV either continuously or in 6 divided doses
plus gentamicin 1 mg/kg IM or IV q8h × 4 wk
2. Penicillin allergy: Vancomycin 30 mg/kg/d × 4 wk in 2 daily doses not to exceed
2 g/d
3. Penicillin allergy, cephalosporins: Cefazolin, 1 g IM or IV q8h × 4 wk
c. Penicillin-resistant streptococci including enterococci and strains with
minimum inhibitory concentrations of >0.5 /g/mL
1. Aqueous penicillin G 18–30 mil units/d IV either continuously or in 6 divided
doses plus gentamicin, 1 mg/kg IM or IV q8h × 4–6 wk

2. Ampicillin 12 g/d IV either continuously or in 6 divided doses plus gentamicin 1
mg/kg IM or IV q8h × 4–6 wk
3. Penicillin allergy: Vancomycin 30 mg/kg/d IV in 2 doses not to exceed 2 g/24 hr
unless serum levels are monitored plus gentamicin 1 mg/kg IM or IV q8h × 4–6
wk. Gentamicin is not required for viridans streptococci
Note:
Streptococci, groups B, C, and G: Some recommend routine use of
penicillin or cephalosporin × 4–6 wk plus gentamicin × 2 wk
Strep bovis endocarditis is associated with colonic carcinoma
Patients with symptoms for over 3 mo before treatment and those with
prosthetic valve endocarditis should receive combined treatment for 6 wk
Aminoglycosides: Gentamicin is usually preferred; MIC should be
T500–2000 Pg/mL for gentamicin or T2000 Pg/mL for streptomycin.
Serum levels should be monitored: Desirable peak levels are streptomycin
20 Pg/mL and gentamicin 3 Pg/mL. Some authorities recommend
gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg q8h with goal for peak serum concentration of 5
Pg/mL. Usual dose of streptomycin is 7.5 mg/kg IM q12h, not to exceed
500 mg. Streptomycin is more ototoxic, which is often irreversible.
Gentamicin is more often nephrotoxic, which is usually reversible
For enterococcal endocarditis, shorter courses of aminoglycosides (2–3 wks
vs. 4–6 wks) may be adequate (CID 2002;34:159.)
Expected bacteriologic cure rate: >95%; expected survival rate: >90%
2. Staphylococcus aureus or S. epidermidis
a. No prosthetic device—methicillin-sensitive
1. Nafcillin or oxacillin 2 g IV q4h × 4–6 wk with optional addition of gentamicin 1
mg/kg IV or IM q8h × 3–5 days.

2. Penicillin allergy, cephalosporin: Cefazolin 2 g IV q8h × 4–6 wk with optional
addition of gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV or IM q8h × 3–5 days (should not be used
with immediate-type penicillin hypersensitivity).
3. Penicillin allergy or methicillin-resistant strains: Vancomycin 30 mg/kg/d
P.260
in two daily doses (not to exceed 2 g/d unless serum levels monitored) × 4–6
wk. With inadequate response, add aminoglycoside × 3–5 days.
4. Parenteral drug abuse with tricuspid valve endocarditis: Oxacillin or nafcillin +
tobramycin parenterally × 2 wk (Ann Intern Med 1988;109:619.; Eur J Clin
Microbiol Infect Dis 1994;13:559.). Vancomycin is not an adequate substitute
for nafcillin in this 2-week course (Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis
1994;13:533.). Abbreviated course is not recommended for HIV-positive
patients or those with persistent fever >7 days or with vegetations >1–2 cm
(NEJM 2001;345:1318.).
b. Prosthetic valve or prosthetic material
1. Methicillin-sensitive strains: Nafcillin or oxacillin 2 g IV q4h × I6 wk plus
rifampin 300 mg po q8h × I6 wk plus gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV or IM q8h (not to
exceed 80 mg) × 2 wk.*
2. Methicillin-resistant strains: Vancomycin 30 mg/kg/d in 2–4 doses (not to
exceed 2 g/d unless serum levels monitored) × I6 wk plus rifampin 300 mg po
q8h × I6 wk plus gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV or IM q8h (not to exceed 80 mg) × 2
wk.*
Note:
Methicillin-resistant staphylococci should be considered resistant to cephalosporins
Vancomycin is considered inferior to oxacillin or nafcillin for methicillin-sensitive
strains of S. aureus (Ann Intern Med 1991;115:674.)
Tolerance has no important effect on antibiotic selection

The occasional strains of staphylococci that are sensitive to penicillin G at <0.1
Pg/mL may be treated with regimens advocated for penicillin-sensitive streptococci
Use of rifampin in prosthetic valve endocarditis will increase required dose of
coumadin
For native valve endocarditis, the addition of gentamicin to nafcillin or oxacillin
causes a more rapid clearing of bacteremia in patients with left-sided endocarditis
(2.5 vs 4.0 days) but has no impact on cure rates; use of gentamicin (or rifampin)
with either methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant strains is sometimes
advocated for the first 3–5 days of treatment with a beta-lactam or vancomycin ( CID
1993;17:313.)
Duration of treatment: 4–6 wk, 6 wk commonly recommended for left-sided
staphylococcal endocarditis
Coagulase-negative strains infecting prosthetic valves should be considered
methicillin-resistant unless sensitivity is conclusively demonstrated
Aminoglycoside selection for coagulase-negative strains should be selected on the
basis of in vitro sensitivity tests; if not active, these agents should be omitted
Expected outcome: CID 1992;15:589.

4. Fungi (Candida sp and Aspergillus sp)* (not included in committee recommendations)
a. Amphotericin B 0.8–1.0 mg/kg/d IV + flucytosine 100–150 mg/kg/d po
b. Fluconazole 400 mg/d IV or po (susceptible Candida sp. only: Experience limited,
but anecdotal experience favorable; experience with fluconazole in combination with
flucytosine, rifampin, etc also is limited)
5. Organisms with special culture requirements: HACEK (see above), Coxiella burnetii

(serology), Brucella, N. gonorrhoeae, Legionella, Bartonella, corynebacteria, Listeria,
nutritionally variant streptococci, nocardia, mycoplasma, chlamydia, and mycobacteria
B. Outpatient Treatment
1. Ceftriaxone once daily for penicillin-sensitive viridans streptococci
2. Use of portable computerized pumps for multiple dose or continuous-infusion therapy.
3. Dual-lumen central catheter with two portable pumps permits combination therapy.

Uncontrolled infection
Fungal endocarditis
Persistent bacteremia (or persistent signs of sepsis)
Lack of effective antimicrobial agents
Unstable prosthetic valve
B. Relative Indications for Cardiac Surgery
1. Native valve

Bacterial agent other than susceptible streptococci (especially P. aeruginosa,
Brucella, Coxiella, fungi, and resistant enterococci)
Relapse (especially if nonstreptococcal agent)
Evidence of intracardiac extension
Rupture of sinus of Valsalva or ventricular septum
Ruptured chordae tendineae or papillary muscle
Heart block (new conduction disturbance)

Early postoperative endocarditis (<8 wk)
Nonstreptococcal late endocarditis
Periprosthetic leak
Two or more emboli
Relapse
Evidence of intracardiac extension (see above)
Miscellaneous: Heart failure, aortic valve involvement, new or increased regurgitant
murmur or mechanical valve versus bioprosthesis
C. Echocardiographic Findings that Suggest Potential Need for Surgery (AHA Committee

on Infectious Endocarditis—Circulation 1998; 98:2936.):
1. Persistent vegetations after major embolic event
2. Large vegetations (>1 cm) mitral valve
3. Increase vegetation size after 4 wk of therapy
4. Acute mitral insufficiency
5. Valve perforation or rupture
6. Periannular extension of infection
D. Point system: Urgent surgery should be strongly considered with five accumulated points
(indications for surgery in infective endocarditis. In Sande MA, Kaye D (Eds). Contemporary
Issues in Infectious Disease. New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1984:201–212).

*Criterion is I5 points.
Note: This point system above has never been validated.
Alternative: An alternative point system is based on 6 factors that predict mortality within 6
months: mental status—4; Charlison co-morbidity score—1–6*; CHF-3, pathogen other than
Strep. viridans—6–8; and medical vs surgical treatment—5.

Footnotes
*NEJM 2001;345:1318; JID 2002;185:1761
*Surgery often required. If strain is resistant to aminoglycosides, avoid these drugs; use
fluoroquinolone if susceptible. If surgery performed, examine in vitro sensitivities because these often
change during treatment.
*Early surgery virtually always required
*Note: The validity of these criteria for surgery have never been shown (JAMA 2003;289:1933)
*1 = myocardial infarct, stroke, dementia, ulcer, mild liver disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease; 2 =
severe renal disease, complicated diabetes, hemiparesis, tumor; 3 = severe liver disease; 6 =
metastatic cancer, immunodeficiency
Validity testing in 513 patients showed the following mortality data at 6 mo: <6: 6%; 7–11: 17%,

12–15: 31%, >15: 63% (JAMA 2003;289:1933). (This system predicts mortality rather than indications
for surgery, but the authors suggest utility in surgical decisions.)

Intra-Abdominal Sepsis: Antibiotic Selection
I. PERITONITIS
A. Recommended antibiotics for community-acquired intra-abdominal infections
(Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, CID—2003;37:997)
1. Single agent regimens
a. Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitors
Ampicillin—sulbactam
Piperacillin—tazobactam*
Ticarcillin—clavulanate
b. Carbapenems
Ertapenem
Imipenem*
Meropenem*
2. Combination regimens
a. Cephalosporin-based regimens
Cefazolin or cefuroxime + metronidazole

Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime or cefepime + metronidazole*
b. Fluoroquinolone-based regimens
Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin, each in combination with
metronidazole
c. Monobactam-based regimen
Aztrenam + metronidazole
B. Miscellaneous recommendations
1. Nosocomial intra-abdominal sepsis (healthcare associated): Anticipate resistant
pathogens with emperic treatment including P. aeruginosa Enterobacter, MRSA,
enterococci and Candida. Treatment should be based on local resistance patterns
(emperic) and culture results (pathogen directed)
2. Anaerobes especially B. fragilis: Cefoxitin and cefotetan can no longer be recommended
3. Oral therapy of mixed infections:
Quinolone + metronidazole
Amoxicillin-clavulanate
4. Microbiology
Anaerobes: Culture and sensitivity testing is usually unnecessary. Resistance is
increasing to clindamycin, cefoxitin, cefotetan, piperacillin, and fluoroquinolones.
Consider in vitro sensitivity testing for anaerobes that persist, cause bacteremia, or
require prolonged therapy
Blood cultures: Not generally recommended
Gram stain: Not recommended for community acquired infections. May be
recommended for healthcare associated infections to detect MRSA and enterococci
5. Treatment of specific pathogens

Candida: Antifungal therapy is generally not warranted unless there is
immunosuppression, transplantation or with post-op patient
Enterococcus: Community acquired infection—do not treat; healthcare associated—treat
based on in vitro susceptibility tests
6. Biliary tract: Direct therapy at Enterobacteraceae, not enterococci; cover anaerobes only
with bile duct—bowel anastomosis
P.268
7. Necrotizing pancreatitis: Antibiotics as advocated for intra-abdominal sepsis
8. Duration of antibiotics: Until clinical signs of infection resolve including fever and
leukocytosis plus a functioning GI tract
C. Monomicrobial infections
1. Spontaneous peritonitis or “primary peritonitis” (Arch Intern Med 97:169, 1994)*
a. Aztreonam 1 g IV q8h × 14 days ± agent for Gram-positive bacteria
b. Cefotaxime 1.5–2.0 g IV q6h or ceftriaxone 1–2 gm IV qd, each ± ampicillin 2 g IV
q6h × 14 days
c. Ticarcillin-clavulanate 3 g IV q6h × 14 days
d. Gentamicin or tobramycin 2 mg/kg IV, then 1.7 mg/kg q8h plus a beta-lactam:
1. Cefoxitin 2 g IV q6h;
2. cefotaxime 1.5–2.0 mg IV q6h; or
3. piperacillin 4–5 g IV q6h × 14 days
2. Candida peritonitis (diagnostic criteria and indications to treat in absence of peritoneal
dialysis are nebulous): Amphotericin B 200–1000 mg (total dose), 1 mg over 6 hr, then
maintenance dose of 20–30 mg/d; utility of fluconazole is not established
3. Tuberculous peritonitis (see p 166)

II. LOCALIZED INFECTIONS
A. Intra-abdominal abscess(es) not further defined: Use regimens recommended for
polymicrobial infections with peritonitis (See “I. Peritonitis” above).
B. Liver Abscess
1. Amebic
a. Preferred: Metronidazole 750 mg po or IV tid × 10 days plus diloxanide furoate,
500 mg po tid × 10 days or paromomycin 500 mg po bid × 7 days
b. Alternative: Emetine 1 mg/kg/d IM × 5 days (or dehydroemetine 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/d
× 5 days) followed by chloroquine 500 mg po bid 2 days, then 250 mg po bid × 3 wk
plus iodoquinol 650 mg po tid × 20 days
2. Pyogenic: Metronidazole plus ampicillin plus 1) an aminoglycoside, 2) third generation
cephalosporin, or 3) aztreonam
C. Biliary Tract Infections
1. Cholecystitis
a. Combination treatment: Gentamicin or tobramycin 2.0 mg/kg IV then 1.7 mg/kg
IV q8h plus ampicillin 2 g IV q6h, piperacillin 2–5 g IV q6h, or cefoperazone 1–2 g
IV q12h*
b. Single agent: Cefoperazone 1–2 g IV q12h*. Ampicillin + sulbactam, 1–2 g
(ampicillin) IV q6h; ticarcillin-clavulanate 3 g IV q6h; for mild infections the usual
recommendation is cefazolin 1–2 g IM or IV q8h, or ampicillin 1–2 g IV q6h
c. Medical Letter consultants (Med Lett, 41:95, 1999):
1. Piperacillin or mezlocillin plus metronidazole,
2. piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam ± aminoglycoside
2. Ascending cholangitis, empyema of the gallbladder, or emphysematous cholecystitis:
Treat with regimens advocated for peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscess

P.269
D. Appendicitis: Recommendations of the Surgical Infection Society (Arch Surg 127:83,
1992)
Antibiotic treatment is started pre-op using regimens advocated for peritonitis (p 127)
1. Appendix is normal or inflamed but not perforated: Discontinue antibiotics
2. Gangrene or perforation: Continue antibiotics until clinical improvement with return of
bowel function, patient is afebrile, and WBC is <12,000/mm 3
E. Diverticulitis: Recommendations of the Surgical Infection Society (Arch Surg 127:83,
1992)
1. Hospitalized patients: Use regimens advocated for peritonitis (p 267)
2. Outpatients:
a. Amoxicillin + clavulanate
b. Fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole
c. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

Footnotes
*Includes severe infections
*Antibiotics should be adjusted according to sensitivities of implicated strain; rate of positive cultures is
30–40% with blood cultures, 40–65% routine culture of ascites fluid, and 90% with ascites fluid
inoculated into blood culture bottles (Gastroenterology 95:1351, 1988).
*Other cephalosporins (second and third generation) are probably equally effective. Some authorities
add ampicillin (1–2 g IV q6h) to cephalosporin-containing regimens.

APPROACH TO INFECTION DIARRHEA

Figure. No caption available

Guidelines from the IDSA (CID 2001; 32:331). (Reprinted with permission)
1. Seafood exposure: culture for vibrio
2. Travelers diarrhea: evaluate if unresponsive to fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX
3. Abdominal pain: Test for Yersinia and enterohemorrhagic E. coli
4. Proctitis in gay men: sigmoidoscopy
5. HUS: Test for enterohemorrhagic E. coli
6. Outbreaks: Notify health department

7. Fecal lactoferrin test or microscopy
8. Blood diarrhea: Some experts avoid antimicrobials
9. Common tests for parasites: Fluorescence and EIA for Giardia and Crypto-sporidium, Cyclospora or
Mycobacteria; chromotrope of microsporidia
P.278
B. Nonantibiotic Management
1. Cholera-like illness: Oral rehydration therapy with Ceralyte, Pedialyte, or generic solutions
prepared by mixing in 1L—3.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g NaHCO 3 , 1.5 g KCl, and 20 g glucose
2. Foods matched to form of stool: Watery—soups, broth, yogurt, soft drinks, vegetables, fresh fruit,
Jell-O ± saltine crackers; some form—rice, bread, baked potato, broiled fish or broiled chicken
(avoid milk, fried food, spicy food)
3. Drugs: Antiperistaltics are contraindicated with diarrhea because of enterohemorrhagic E. coli or
Clostridium difficile
a. Loperamide 4 mg, then 2 mg/diarrheal stool up to 16 mg/d (avoid with fever and dysentery)
b. Diphenoxylate (no more effective plus potential for opiate toxicity and anti-cholinergic
effects)
c. Bismuth subsalicylate: 30 mL (2 tabs) q 30 min × 8 doses, 1–2 days (good safety profile)
d. Attapulgite: 1.2 g (30 cc) with each diarrheal stool up to 8.4 g (good safety profile and
preferred to kaolin/pectin)
C. Fecal Leukocyte Exam (Lactoferrin test or stool microscopy)

D. Empiric Antibiotic Treatment (IDSA Guidelines—CID 32:331, 2001)
1. Domestically acquired infectious diarrhea
1. Acute diarrhea: Fever and acute diarrhea (nonbloody)—treat for shigellosis
2. Chronic diarrhea: Diarrhea >10–14 days—treat for giardiasis
3. Antibiotic treatment in these settings is arbitrary; antibiotic treatment with diarrhea caused by
enterohemorrhagic E. coli may be harmful.
2. Travelers' diarrhea (CID 2000; 31:1079)
1. Severity
Mild (1–2 stools/24 hr) no systemic sx: No therapy or loperamide or bismuth
Moderate (>2 stools/24 hr) + no systemic sx: Loperamide or bismuth

Moderate (>2 stools/24 hr) + “distressing sx”: Loperamide + fluoroquino-lone until
diarrhea stops (up to 3 days)
Severe (>6 stools/24 hr), fever and/or bloody stools: Fluoroquinolone for 1–3 days
3. Agents
Loperamide 4 mg × 1 then 2 mg with each loose stool (V16 mg/d) or bismuth subsalicylate
(Pepto-Bismol 2 tabs qid, each loose stool)
Antibiotic regimens: Norfloxacin 400 mg bid × 1–3 days or ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid × 1–3
days or levofloxacin 500 mg qd × 1–3 days
Alternative antibiotics: TMP-SMX 2 DS × 1 or 1 DS bid × 3 days or azithromycin 1000 mg × 1
or 500 mg qd × 3 days

Expected cure refers to eradication of uropathogen andelimination of symptoms. Data
provided are expectations based on prior studies with evaluationsduring treatment at 5–9
days post-treatment and 4–6 wk post-treatment. Positive cultures post-treatment are
classified as relapse (same strain), usually indicating renal or prostatic nidus of infection
or reinfection indicating new uropathogen.

Based on recommendations of SD Fihn (NEJM 2003;349:3.)
1. Diagnostic tests: The urinary dipstick has largely replaced the urine culture and urine
microscopy because it is cheaper, faster, and more convenient. The relative merits of
these tests are summarized in the following table:

Many patients do not need any testing, but can be managed by telephone
consultation. Published protocols include women at low risk for complicated
infection, who do not have symptoms suggesting vaginitis or cervicitis and in some
cases are limited to women >55% years of age (Am J Med 1999;106:636.; Br J Gen
Prat 2000;50:635.; J Fam Pract 2001;50:589.).
2. Treatment: (see table below) TMP-SMX for three days results in sterile urine within seven
days and about 94%; longer courses do not improve efficacy and increase side effects
while the single dose is less effective (CID 1999;29:745.). The alternative for patients
with sulfa allergy is trimethoprim, but this may also cause hypersensitivity, and TMP
rashes are commonly misidentified as sulfa reactions in patients who get TMP-SMX
(Allergy 1992;47:340.). In some areas the pathogens cultured from urine in acute
cystitis show rates of TMP-SMX resistance of up to 18% (JAMA 1999;281:736.; NEJM
2001;345:1007.), especially if this drug has been given within the previous six months ( J
Gen Intern Med 1999;14:606.). The recommendation is to use alternative drugs if the
patient has recently received antibiotics or if the local prevalence of urinary isolates
exceeds 15–20%. Nevertheless, clinical and bacteriologic cure rates of 80–85% are
expected even when the resistance rates approach 30% ( Ann Intern Med 2001;135:41.).
The major alternative is a fluoroquinolone, but it is not considered “first line” because of
its high cost and concern for abuse. Nitrofurantoin is another option, preferably using the

monohydrate macrocrystal formulation because it is taken just twice daily and causes
less GI toxicity compared to the macrocrystalline formulation. This drug may assume
more importance if there is increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones. Fosfomycin is less
effective than the other agents and should only be used when the others cannot be used
(CID 1999;29:745.). The expected response rate is symptom relief in 90% within 72
hours and negative cultures (if done)at 7 days in over 90%. Severe dysuria may be
treated with phenazopyridine (Pyridium or Uristat) which is now available
over-the-counter. Routine follow-up including urine culture is generally not necessary.

C. MANAGEMENT OF BLADDER CATHETER (Infect Dis Clin Pract 1995;4:446.)
Incidence of infection: 3–10%/day
Prevention
Prevention of infection: Maintain closed system
Prevention of complications of bacteruria: Antibiotics are ineffective
Prevention of catheterization: Condom catheters; intermittent catheterization ±
instillations of povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine; suprapubic catheterization
Treatment: Treat only symptomatic infections (fever and/or signs of
bacteremia)(symptoms are rare in this population—Ann Intern Med 160:668, 2000)
Treat 7–10 days: Parenteral or oral antimicrobial
D. PROSTATITIS (Guidelines of Assoc Genitourinary Med Society of Venereal Disease London
2002)
1. Acute prostatitis
a. Diagnosis: Midstream urine culture and blood culture; do not do prostatic massage

(Pathogens are virtually always in urine)
b. Treatment
1. Initial antibiotic treatment: Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone + gentamicin—switch to
pathogen-specific therapy when sensitivity data available
2. Oral antibiotics: Switch to oral agent when clinically improved. Usual agent:
Ciprofloxacin; alternative: TMP-SMX or trimethoprim × 28 days.
3. Adjunctive treatment: Catheterize for urinary retention, hydration, analgesics
(NSAIDs)
c. Failure to respond: Possible prostatic abscess—transrectal ultrasound or CT scan.
Treatment—perineal or transurethral drainage
2. Chronic prostatitis
Diagnosis: Symptoms P6 months.
Urinary localization procedure (Not often done)
Patient preparation: No antibiotics × 1 month, no ejaculation × 2 days and no
distended bladder
Specimens: 5–10 mL first voided urine (VB#1), void 100–200 mL then
midstream(VB#2), vigorous prostatic massage × 1 minute, then post prostatic
massage (PPM) urine of 5–10 mL (VB#3). All three samples have microscopy and
quantitative urine cultures.
Interpretation
1. Bacterial infection: Culture of VB#3 P10 × that of VB#2 and VB#1 Dx: “chronic
bacterial prostititis”
2. Inflammation: >10 PMNs/HPF in prostatic massage specimen or in VB#3. Dx:
“Chronic bacterial prostatitis” or “chronic abacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic
pain syndrome—inflammatory”

3. Culture and WBC assessment are negative. Dx: “Chronic abacterial
prostatitis/chronicpelvic pain syndrome—inflammatory”.

Sexually transmitted diseases
Recommendations from the CDC (MMWR 2002;51:RR-6.)
I. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gonococcal Infections)
A. Treatment Recommendations for Uncomplicated Localized Infections (urethral, endocervical, and
rectal) (CID 1995;20:S47.; Med Lett 1995;37:117.)
Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM × 1 or
Ciprofloxacin* 500 mg po × 1 or
Ofloxacin* 400 mg po × 1 or
Levofloxacin 250 mg × 1 or
Cefixime 400 mg po × 1
All of the above should be combined with treatment for C. trachomatis unless this has been ruled out:
Doxycycline 100 mg po bid × 7 days; azithromycin (1 g po × 1) is an alternative.
Alternative: 1) Spectinomycin 2 g IM × 1. (Spectomycin may not be commercially available), 2)
Cefotaxime 500 mg IM, 3) Gatifloxacin 400 mg po × 1 or norfloxacin 800 mg po. Azithromycin in a
dose of 2 g is effective treatment for both gonorrhea and C. trachomatis, but GI side effects are
frequent, cost is high, and gonococcal cure rates are relatively low (93%)
B. Special Considerations
1. Syphilis: All patients with gonorrhea should be screened for syphilis at initial visit. Regimens with
ceftriaxone or a 7-day course of doxycycline or erythromycin may cure incubating syphilis.
2. Follow-up: Patients who respond need no follow-up. Patients with persistent symptoms should have

culture for N. gonorrhoeae and in vitro susceptibility testing; mostare due to re-infection, indicating
need for partner referral or nongonococcal urethritis. Expected response rate B95%.
3. Infection control: Patients should avoid sexual intercourse until the patient and partner (see below)
are cured. This means no sexual contact until therapy is completed and both are asymptomatic.
4. Sex partners: Partners should be referred for evaluation and treatment of N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis. This includes sex partners within 30 days for symptomatic infection and those within 60
days for asymptomatic infection.
5. Reporting: All states require reporting of N. gonorrhoeae.
6. Pregnancy: Quinolones and tetracyclines are contraindicated. For N. gonorrhoeaea a cephalosporin or
spectinomycin is preferred. For C. tracho matis, amoxicillin or erythromycin is preferred.
7. HIV infection: Standard recommendations apply.
C. Gonococcal Infections at Selected Sites*
1. Pharyngitis: Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM or ciprofloxacin 500 mg po (both withdoxycycline 100 mg po bid ×
7 days) or azithromycin 1 g po
2. Conjunctivitis*: Ceftriaxone 1 g IM × 1 plus lavage of infected eye × 1
3. Disseminated gonococcal infections*
a. Hospitalization is recommended, especially for noncompliant patients, uncertain diagnosis,
patients with purulent synovial effusions, or other complications.
b. Recommended treatment: Ceftriaxone 1 g IV or IM daily
Alternative regimens: Cefotaxime 1 g IV q8h or ceftizoxime 1 g IV q8h,
P.289
ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h, ofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h, levofloxacin 250 mg IV/d, or
spectinomycin 2 g IM q12h
Duration of parenteral treatment: 24–48 hr after symptoms resolve, then cefixime 400
mg po bid, ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid, ofloxacin 500 mg po bid, or levofloxacin 500 mg po
qd
Duration of oral treatment: To complete a full week of antibiotic treatment
4. Meningitis*: Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV q12h × 10–14 days

5. Endocarditis*: Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV qd × 4 wk
6. Salpingitis : See pelvic inflammatory disease
II. Syphilis
A. Classification
1. Primary: Ulcer or chancre at site of infection
2. Secondary: Rash, mucocutaneous lesions, adenopathy
3. Tertiary (late): Cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmic, auditory, or gummatous lesions
4. Latent syphilis: No evidence of disease
Early latent: Acquired syphilis within 1 yr based on seroconversion B4–fold increase in titer, history of
primary or secondary syphilis, or sex partner with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis
Late latent: Infection >1 yr; syphilis of unknown duration should be managed as late latent syphilis
B. Diagnosis
1. Direct exam (lesion exudate or tissue): Dark-field or direct fluorescent antibody tests
2. Serology: Requires treponemal and nontreponemal tests for diagnosis
a. Treponemal: Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed FTA-ABS or microhemagglutinin for
antibody (MHATP). Reported as reactive or nonreactive, titers do not correlate with assay disease
activity; patients who react usually remain reactive for life regardless of treatment or disease
activity
b. Nontreponemal: Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagin (RPR).
Results should be reported quantitatively. Titers correlate with disease activity. 4-fold changes in
titer are required to demonstrate a significant difference. Sequential tests should be done in the
same lab. VDRL and RPR are equally valid, although quantitative results cannot be directly
compared. It is expected that this test will become nonreactive with treatment, but some stay
reactive for long periods, e.g., serofast reaction
c. Neurosyphilis:
(1) Positive CSF VDRL or RPR is considered diagnostic if specimen is not contaminated with
blood. This test is negative in about one-third with neurosyphilis. Some advocate CSF
FTA-ABS, which is less specific but thought to be highly sensitive

(2) CSF leukocytosis (>5 WBC/mm 3 ) is expected in active neurosyphilis and is a sensitive
measure of effectiveness of therapy
d. HIV: Standard serologic tests are usually accurate but rare false negatives are reported. There is
an increased risk of neurosyphilis
C. Treatment: Penicillin G is preferred for all stages
1. Primary and secondary
P.290
a. Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 mil units IM × 1
b. Follow-up: Patients should be re-examined clinically and serologically at 6 and12 mo. Patients
with HIV should have evaluations at 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 mo ± LP at 6 mo. Treatment failure or
reinfection is diagnosed if symptoms persist, symptoms recur, or 4-fold increase in VDRL or RPR
titer by 6–12 mo: 1) Evaluate for HIV, 2) perform LP, and 3) retreat with benzathine penicillin
2.4 mil units IM × 3 (weekly)
c. If titer does not decrease by 4-fold at 6 mo then 1) evaluate for HIV, 2) follow-up clinical and
serologic exams at 6 mo (3-mo intervals for HIV-infected patients), and 3) retreat if follow-up
cannot be assured—benzathine penicillin 2.4 mil units IM × 3 (weekly)
d. HIV serology: Indicated in all patients with syphilis; patients in high prevalence areas for HIV
should be retested at 3 mo
e. LP: Indicated in primary and secondary syphilis only if there are clinical signs and symptoms of
neurologic involvement (ophthalmic, auditory symptoms, cranial nerve palsies) or with
therapeutic failures
Ophthalmic disease (uveitis): Slit lamp exam
f. Penicillin allergy:
Doxycycline 100 mg po bid × 2 wk or tetracycline 500 mg po qid × 2 wk
Intolerance to tetracyclines (acceptable only in HIV-negative patients):
Erythromycin 500 mg po qid × 2 wk or ceftriaxone 1 g/d for 8- to 10-day course
Pregnancy: Skin test; if positive, desensitize and treat with penicillin *
g. HIV infection: Benzathine penicillin G: 2.4 mil units ×1

h. Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction: Acute febrile reaction accompanied by head ache and myalgias.
There are no proven methods to prevent this. Anti pyretics are recommended for treatment. The
reaction may induce early labor and cause fetal distress in pregnant women
2. Latent syphilis (see “Classification” above)
a. Early latent (syphilis >1 yr): Diagnosis—documented seroconversion, unequivocal history of
primary or secondary syphilis >1 yr previously or sex partner with syphilis>1 yr. Treatment:
Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 mil units IM × 1; penicillin allergy, doxycycline 100 mg bid × 4 wk
b. Late latent (syphilis >1 yr or unknown duration): Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 mil units IM × 3 at
weekly intervals; penicillin allergy, doxycycline 100 mg bid × 4 wk
c. Follow-up: VDRL or RPR at 6, 12, and 24 mo. Patients who develop signs or symptoms of syphilis
have a 4-fold increase in titer or an initial titer of B1:32 that fails to decrease 4-fold in 12–24
mo should have LP and be retreated
d. Indications for LP:
Neurologic or ophthalmic signs or symptoms (ophthalmic, auditory, cranial nerve symptoms)
Other evidence of active disease (aortitis, gumma, iritis, etc)
Treatment failure
HIV infection
P.291
Infection >1 yr or unknown duration plus titer B1:32
Infection >1 yr or unknown duration and nonpenicillin treatment planned
e. HIV serology: Advocated for all syphilis patients
f. Penicillin allergy (nonpregnant patients)
Infection >1 yr: Doxycycline 100 mg po bid or tetracycline 500 mg po qid × 2 wk
Infection >1 yr or unknown duration: Doxycycline 100 mg po bid or tetracycline 500 mg po
qid × 4 wk
Pregnancy: Skin test; if positive, desensitize and treat with penicillin * (MMWR
1993;42(RR-14):44. )

g. HIV infection: LP, if normal—benzathine penicillin 2.4 mil units IM × 3 (weekly)
h. Evaluation: Patients with latent syphilis should be evaluated for tertiary disease—aortitis,
neurosyphilis, gummas, or iritis
3. Neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis
a. Preferred: Aqueous penicillin G 12–24 mil units/d given as 3–4 mil units q4h × 10–14 days
b. Alternative if outpatient compliance is assured: Procaine penicillin IM 2.4 mil units/d plus
probenecid 500 mg po q6h for 10–14 days
c. Penicillin allergy:
Ceftriaxone 2 g/d IV or IM × 10–14 days
Skin test; if positive, desensitize and treat with penicillin *
d. Follow-up: If CSF initially showed pleocytosis, repeat LP q6mo until normal. Also evaluate CSF
VDRL and protein, but these respond less rapidly and are of less certain significance. If cell count
has not decreased by 6 mo or CSF is abnormal at 2 yr then retreat.
4. Late syphilis (other than neurosyphilis): Gumma, cardiovascular syphilis, etc
LP: All patients
Benzathine penicillin 2.4 mil units × 3 at weekly intervals
Penicillin allergy: Doxycycline 100 mg po bid × 4 wk
D. Sex partners
1. Patients sexually exposed to primary secondary or early latent syphilis should be evaluated clinically
and serologically: Contacts should be treated if seropositive or if seronegative and exposed <90 days.
Presumptive treatment should also be given if exposure was >90 days, serologic test results are
unavailable, and source had primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. Patients with syphilis of
unknown duration with a nontreponemal test titer of × 1:32 are considered to have early syphilis for
purposes of partner notification
2. Long-term partners of patients with late syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically
3. Time periods used to identify at-risk sex partners are 3 mo plus duration of symptoms for primary
syphilis, 6 mo plus duration of symptoms for secondary syphilis, and 1 yr for early latent syphilis
E. Pregnancy

1. Testing: All women should have screening tests for syphilis in early pregnancy; this should be
repeated at 28 wk and at delivery in areas of high prevalence or women with high risk
2. Treatment: Penicillin regimens as summarized above. Penicillin allergy: skin test and desensitize if
positive. Note: Some experts recommend a second dose of benzathine penicillin2.4 mil units at 1 wk
for pregnant women with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis
3. Jarish-Herxheimer reaction: Pregnant women treated for syphilis in the second half of pregnancy who
have a Jarish-Herxheimer reaction have increased risk of premature labor and fetal distress

III. Chlamydia Trachomatis (MMWR 1993;42(RR-12).)
A. Spectrum of disease
Men: Nongonococcal urethritis, epididymitis, proctitis, and proctocolitis (renal intercourse)
Women: Mucopurulent cervicitis, salpingitis (PID), postpartum endometritis, cystitis (acute
dysuria-pyuria or urethral syndrome), perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), proctitis, and
proctocolitis
Infants (postexposure): Conjunctivitis and pneumonitis
Miscellaneous: Reiter's syndrome (reactive arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis), chronic
conjunctivitis, pharyngeal colonization (but not pharyngitis)
B. Screening candidates
Mucopurulent cervicitis
Sexually active women <20 yr
Women 20–24 yr who meet the following criteria and those >24 yr who meet both criteria:
Inconsistent use of barrier contraceptives or new or >1 sex partner in past 3 mo
Pregnant females during third trimester
Screening women is the major element of a chlamydial prevention program.
Verification of initial positive test should be performed if the test was not a positive culture and the
patient is considered low risk.
C. Detection
1. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ) and ligase chain reaction
(LCR) (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). These assays require about 8 hr and show sensitivity of
86–98%; specificity is 99–100%, and they can be performed on urine. The cost is $14–28/specimen
(although commercial labs charge more)

F. Disease prevention: Patient should avoid sex for 7 days from initiation of treatment, and until all
partners are treated and cured
G. Partner referral: Evaluation and treatment of partners within 60 days. Last sex partner should be
evaluated, tested, and treated regardless of the time interval
H. Reporting: C. trachomatis has required reporting in most states

Treatment has no effect on rate or frequency of relapses
2. Recurrent episodes: Should be started with the prodrome or within 1 day of onset of lesions
3. Prophylaxis: Consider with > 6 recurrences/yr: Safety and efficacy are documented for continuous
prophylaxis up to 10 yr without cumulative toxicity or risk of resistance (JID 1994;169:1338.). There
is also a significant reduction in viral shedding. Suppressive treatment is contra indicated in
pregnancy

5. Pregnancy: Registry to report exposure experiences with acyclovir or valacyclovir: 800-722-9292, ext
58465. To date the experience shows no risk to the infant with 601 exposures to acyclovir; this
sample size is adequate to detect a 2-fold teratogenic risk over the 3% baseline rate of birth defects
(MMWR 1993;42:806.). There are sparse data about famciclovir or valacyclovir in pregnant women, so
acyclovir is preferred. Indications for acyclovir in pregnancy:
First episode of genital herpes
Severe genital HSV or extragenital HSV disease (encephalitis, disseminated disease, etc.)
6. Perinatal infections: Most perinatal HSV infections occur with mothers who have no history of HSV.
Risk of transmission is highest with delivery at the time the mother has primary HSV (30–50%); risk
with recurrent HSV at the time of delivery is about 3%. Women at risk (HSV negative pregnant woman
and HSV infected partner) should be warned of risk of unprotected sexual contact in late pregnancy
P.296
B. Management of pregnancies complicated by genital herpes simplex
1. No signs of genital HSV at onset of delivery—vaginal delivery
2. HSV lesions at onset of labor—most recommend C-section
3. eSvere genital HSV during pregnancy—oral or IV acyclovir
C. Neonatal herpes: Treat infant with acyclovir 30–60 mg/kg/d ×10–21 days
VI. Chancroid
A. Agent: Haemophilus ducreyi
B. Clinical features: Painful genital ulcers ± tender inguinal adenopathy with or without suppuration;
uncommon in U.S. (MMWR 1995;44:567.)
C. Diagnosis: Culture requires specialized media that are not commercially available. Even with these media,
the yield is <80%. PCR may soon be available. Presumptive diagnosis: Typical clinical findings plus no
evidence of syphilis (dark-field of lesion exudate or negative serology at least 7 days after onset of ulcer)
and atypical for herpes simplex or negative tests for herpes simplex. Presence of suppurative inguinal

adenopathy is nearly diagnostic
D. Treatment (CID 1995;20:539.)
1. Preferred:
Azithromycin 1 g po × 1 or
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM × 1 or
Erythromycin base 500 mg po qid × 7 days
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid × 3 days (contraindicated in pregnant or lactating women and with
age <18 yr)
2. Alternatives: None
3. HIV infection: All regimens are less effective—azithromycin and multiple dose regimens are preferred
(STD 1994;21:231.)
E. Follow-up: Symptoms improve within 3 days, and objective improvement is seen within 7 days. Examine
3–7 days after treatment. If not improved, consider wrong diagnosis, co-infection (10% coinfected with
HSV or T. pallidum), HIV infection, noncompliance, H. ducreyi, resistance to (rare with recommended
treatments), need for needle aspiration of fluctuant adenopathy.
F. Partner referral: Examine and treat partners <10 days
G. HIV infection: Longer treatment or close follow-up
VII. Granuloma inguinale (Donovanosis)
A. Agent: Calymmatobacterium granulomatis
B. Geography: Rare in U.S.; endemic in India, Australia, South Africa, New Guinea
C. Clinical presentation: Painless, progressive genital ulcer that is highly vascularized (beefy red) and
bleeds easily
D. Treatment
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 DS bid until healed (B21 days)
Doxycycline 100 mg bid until healed (B21 days)
Alternative: Ciprofloxacin 750 mg bid × 21 days, erythromycin 500 mg po qid × 21 days, or
azithromycin 1 g/wk × 3

P.297
E. Sex partners: Examine partners within 60 days and treat those with symptoms
F. Pregnancy: Erythromycin ±aminoglycoside (gentamicin)
G. HIV infection: Consider adding gentamicin to treatment regimen
VIII. Pediculosis Pubis (Pubic Lice)
A. Teatment
Permethrin (1%) cream rinse (Nix) applied to affected area and washed after 10 min or
Lindane (1%) shampoo applied 4 min and then thoroughly washed off (not recommended for pregnant
or lactating women) or
Pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (nonprescription) applied to affected areas and washed off after 10
min
Note: Permethrin has less potential toxicity with inappropriate use; lindane is least expensive and
non-toxic if used correctly
B. Adjunctive: Retreat after 7 days if lice or eggs are detected at hair–skin junction. Clothes and bed linen
of past 2 days should be decontaminated (machine washed or machine dried using hot cycle or dry
cleaned) or removed from body contact at least 12 hr
C. Follow-up: Evaluate at 1 wk if symptoms persist. Retreat if lice or eggs are seen at hair–skin junctions
D. Pregnancy: Permethrin or pyrethrins
E. Sex partners: Treat sex partners within preceding month as above
IX. Scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei)
A. Symptoms: Pruritus
B. Recommended: Permethrin (5% cream, 30 g) massaged and left 8–14 hr(preferred—Semin Dermatol
12:22, 1993). Lindane considered preferable drug for scabies by Medical Letter consultants (Med Lett
1995;37:117.)
C. Alternatives: Lindane (1%) 1 oz lotion or 30 g cream applied thinly to all areas of the body below neck
and washed thoroughly at 8 hr (not recommended for pregnantor lactating women) or sulfur (6%)
ointment applied thinly to all areas nightly×3; wash off previous application before new applications and
wash thoroughly 24 hr after last application. Ivermectin (200 Tg/kg po ×1 or 0.8% topical solution)

appears to be effective (NEJM 1995;333:26.)
D. Sex partners and close household contacts: Treat as above
E. Pregnancy: Avoid lindane
F. Adjunctive: Clothing and bed linen contaminated by patient should be decontaminated (machine washed
or machine dried using hot cycle or dry cleaned or removed from body contact ×72 hr)
G. Outbreaks: Control can usually be achieved only by treating the entire population at risk
X. Hepatitis B Rates and risk of HBV are high in patients with STDs. Serologic tests of STD clinic patients show
evidence of past infection in 28% of persons B25 yr and
P.298
7% in those B25 yr. HBV vaccination is recommended for 1) sexually active homosexual and bisexual men; 2)
men and women diagnosed with another STD, and 3) persons with more than one sex partner in the prior 6 mo
(MMWR 1999;48:33.) Usual regimen is three doses at 0, 1, and 6 mo at a cost of about $50/dose (see p 114).
XI. Human Papillomavirus: Warts
A. Types: Exophytic warts are usually benign and caused by HPB types 6 and 11. Types 16, 18, 31, 33, and
35 are associated with genital dysplasia and carcinoma; these types are usually subclinical
B. Treatment goals: No treatment is known to eradicate HPV, reduce risk of cervical dysplasia or cervical
carcinoma, or prevent recurrence (CID 1995;20:S91. ). The goal of therapy is to eliminate the symptoms
and emotional distress associated with exophytic warts
C. Treatments: Determined by wart area, wart count, anatomic site, morphology, cost, patient preference,
and provider experience. Most treatments are 60–70% effective in clearing exophytic warts and show
recurrence rates >25% (Int J Dermatol 1995;34:29.)
1. Patient applied
Podofilox 0.5% soln or gel (Condylox) apply bid × 3 days, then no therapy × 4 days; repeat cycle
up to 4 times. This treatment is relatively brief, inexpensive, safe, and simple. Local pain is
common. The wart area should be <10 cm 2 and the total volume of podofilox should be <0.5 mL
Imiquimod 5% (Aldara) cream (see Med Lett 1997;39:118.)Apply hs 3×/wk—daily for up to 16
wk. Wash with mild soap and water 6–10 hr after application. Local inflammation is common.
More expensive than podofilox (AWP $432/16 wk vs $56/4 wk for podofilox)
2. Provider applied

Cryotherapy: liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe, repeat q1–2wk. Requires technical expertise
Podophyllin resin 10–25% applied to wart and air-dried. Repeat weekly
Trichloroacetic acid or bichloroacetic acid 80–90% applied to wart and air-dried
3. Alternative treatments
Laser surgery
Intralesional interferon: Rarely recommended because of systemic reactions and requirement for
multiple visits
Management by anatomical site
Cervical warts: Must consult expert to exclude high-grade SIL
Vaginal warts: Cryotherapy or podophyllin
Meatal warts: Cryotherapy or podophyllin 10–25%
Anal warts: Cryotherapy, surgical removal, or TCA/BCA 80–90%
Oral warts: Cryotherapy or surgical removal
D. Follow-up: Not mandatory after warts have cleared
E. Sex partners: Not necessary because there is no curative therapy and treatment does not reduce
transmission.
F. Pregnancy: Use of podofilox, podophyllin, and imiquimod is contra indicated in pregnancy. HPV types 6
and 11 can cause laryngeal papillomatosis in offspring, but mechanism of transmission is unclear. Cesarean
section should not be performed to prevent this complication.
P.299
G. Subclinical warts: Indirect tests are Pap smear, colposcopy, biopsy, or acetic acid application; definitive
diagnosis requires detection of HPV DNA or RNA or capsid proteins. Pap smear diagnosis does not correlate
well with detection by HPV DNA in cervical cells; cell changes caused by HPV are similar to mild dysplasia
and often regress spontaneously. Therefore, screening for subclinical HPV with nucleic acid or capsid
antigen tests for detection of HPV is not recommended. Management is based on results of dysplasia on
Pap smear.
H. Education: Genital HPV infection is common, usually sexually transmitted, and has a variable incubation
period. Most warts are benign; exophytic genital warts are not associated with carcinoma. Recurrence in 3

months post-treatment is common; likelihood of transmission post-therapy is unknown. The value of
disclosure to prior partners is also unknown.

XIII. Urethritis
A. Diagnosis: Any of the following
Mucoid or purulent urethral discharge
Positive leukocyte esterase test on first voided urine or microscopic exam of first voided urine
showing > 10 WBC/HPF
Urethral Gram stain showing >5 WBC/HPF
B. Microbiology: Evaluate for gonococcal and chlamydial infection.
Gonococcal: Presumptive evidence is urethral discharge with >5 WBC/HPF plus typical Gram-negative
diplococci.
Nongonococcal: C. trachomatis (20–55%), Ureaplasma urealyticium (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis

(2–5%), HSV (rare)
C. Management
1. Gram stain of discharge
a. Gram-negative intracellular displococci +>5 WBC/HPF: Treat for N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis; refer partners
b. Negative Gram stain + >5 WBC/HPF: Test for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis; treat for C.
trachomatis; refer partners if tests are positive
c. Negative tests: Test for N. gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis; defer treatment pending test
results unless patient is at high risk and unlikely to return: treat patient and partner for N.
gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis
P.300
2. Gram stain unavailable: Test for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis; treat for N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis; refer partners if tests are positive
3. Nongonococcal urethritis: Treat for C. trachomatis
D. Sex partners: Evaluate and treat sex partners within V60 days of symptomatic patients or last sex
partner if last sex preceded intervals.
E. Follow-up and disease prevention: Avoid sex until patient and partner have completed 7 days of therapy.
F. Persistent or recurrent urethritis
1. Reexposure or noncompliance with original regimen: Retreat
2. Compliant and no reexposure: Intraurethral swab for wet mount and culture for T. vaginalis.
Treatment is metronidazole 2 g po × 1 plus either
Erythromycin base 500 mg po qid × 7 days or
Erythromycin ethylsuccinate 800 mg po qid ×7 days
XIV. Epididymitis
A. Microbiology
Men <35 yr: N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis; gay men are likely to have enteric pathogens as well
Men >35 yr: E. coli and other urinary tract pathogens

P.301
B. Diagnosis: (1) Urethral smear for Gram stain for N. gonorrhoeae and nongonococcal urethritis (B5
WBC/OIF) suggests gonococcal infection, (2)urine LCR for N. gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis, (3)
uncentrifuged urine for WBCs and Gram stain for GNB.
C. Treatment
N. gonorrhoeae: Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM × 1 plus doxycycline, 100 mg po bid × 10 days
C. trachomatis: Ofloxacin 300 mg po bid × 10 days or levofloxacin 500 mg qd
D. Follow-up: Expect improvement within 3 days; swelling >1 wk—evaluate for testicular cancer, TB, fungal
infections, abscess, or infarction.
E. Sex partners: Evaluate and treat sex partners with sexually transmitted epididymitis if contact was within
60 days and gonococci or C. trachomatis is suspected or confirmed. Patient should avoid sexual intercourse
until patient and partner are cured.
XV. Proctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis
A. Classification

Condition
Proctitis*

Proctocolitis*

Symptoms

Microbiology

Anorectal pain, tenesmus,

N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, syphilis,

constipation, rectal discharge

HSV

Symptoms of proctitis plus
diarrhea ± cramps and

Shigella, E. histolytica, Campylobacter sp,
LGV; C. trachomatis (rare)

inflammation of colonic mucosa
to 12 cm

Enteritis

Diarrhea without signs of
proctitis or colitis

Giardia; HIV infection—CMV, M. avium,
microsporidia, Cryptosporidium-Isospora,
Salmonella

* Proctitis indicates inflammation limited to the distal 10–12 cm of the colon. Proctocolitis shows
inflammation extending beyond 12 cm.

B. Diagnosis (proctitis): Anoscopy with evaluation of anorectal pus for PMNs, Gram stain, and evaluation
for gonococci, C. trachomatis, syphilis, and HSV
C. Treatment (proctitis with history of recent receptive anal intercourse plus anorectal pus):
Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM plus doxycycline 100 mg po bid ×7 days
XVI. Mucopurulent Cervicitis (MPC)
A. Agents: Can be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis, but most cases involve neither. Most women
with gonococcal and chlamydial infections do not have MPC. MPC is not a sensitive predictor of infection.
B. Diagnosis: Yellow endocervical exudate in endocervical canal or in an endocervical swab specimen. Some
women have no symptoms, some have vaginal discharge, and some have abnormal vaginal bleeding,
especially postcoital bleeding.
C. Test: Chlamydia trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae

D. Treatment: Recommendations based on results of tests of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis unless
likelihood of infection with either organism is high or patient is unlikely to return for treatment.
1. Gonococcal endocervicitis: see p 288
2. Chlamydia endocervicitis: see p 293
3. Treat for both if high prevalence of both infections, e.g., many STD clinics
4. Treatment may be delayed for laboratory test results if prevalence of both infections is low and
compliance with return visit is likely
E. Sex partners: Partners of women treated for gonorrhea or C. trachomatis should be examined and
treated; patients should avoid sex until treated, i.e., 7 days.
XVII. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
A. Conditions: PID includes endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis.
B. Microbiology: Most common—N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis; less common—endogenous bacteria
including anaerobes, Gram-negative bacilli, and streptococci. Role of mycoplasma is unclear.
C. Diagnosis: Sexually active women with uterine/adnexal tenderness or cervical motion tenderness.
Additional supporting findings are: (1) oral temperature B101°F, (2) cervical/vaginal mucopurulent
discharge, (3) WBC's in vaginal secretions, (4) increased ESR, (5)elevated CRP, or (6) lab documentation
of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachmatis
D. Indications for hospitalization and/or parenteral antibiotics:
1. Surgical emergency such as possible acute appendicitis
2. Pregnancy
3. Patient failed oral therapy
4. Patient is unable to follow or tolerate oral therapy
5. Severe illness as indicated by high fever, nausea, and vomiting
6. Tubo-ovarian abscess
E. Treatment
1. Parenteral regimen
Cefoxitin 2 g IV q6h or cefotetan 2 g IV q12h until at least 24 hr after clinical improvement plus

doxycycline 100 mg bid po or IV × 14 days*
Clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h plus gentamicin 2 mg/kg IV or IM followed
P.302
by 1.5 mg/kg q8h at least 24 hr after clinical improvement then doxycycline 100 mg po bid × 14
days or clindamycin 450 mg po qid × 14 days clindamycin preferred for tubo-ovarian abscess)
Alternatives/parenteral regimen
Ofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h or levofloxacin 500 mg IV qd plus metronidazole 500 mg IV q12h
Ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g IV q6h plus doxycycline 100 mg IV or po q12h
Ciprofloxacin 200 mg IV q12h plus doxycycline 100 mg IV or po q12h plus metronidazole 500 mg
IV q12h
2. Oral therapy
Single dose parenteral plus oral:
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM × 1 or cefotaxime or
Cefoxitin 2 g IM plus probenecid 1 g po
Plus metronidazole 500 mg po bid × 7 days or
Oral regimen: Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid or levofloxacin 500 mg qd × 14 days plus metronidazole
500 mg po bid × 14 days
F. Follow-up: Patients should show substantial clinical improvement within 3 days. Outpatient evaluation:
Follow-up in 72 hr with expectation of substantial clinical improvement or hospitalization. Patients should
be examined 7–10 days after therapy.
G. Sex partners: Examine all sex partners and treat for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis.
H. Expected clinical cure rates with suggested antibiotic regimens: 85–95% for PID with most failures
ascribed to tubo-ovarian abscesses (CID 1994;19:720. ). Response expected within 3 days. Major concern
is late sequelae with infertility (16%) and ectopic pregnancy (9%) ( STD 1992;19:185.)
XVIII. Vaginitis/Vaginosis:
A. Diagnostic tests:
Requirement: pH paper and 2 slides for microscopy—one with 2 drops of normal saline and the second

with 10% KOH
Interpretation
pH >4.5: Bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis
Saline mount—T. vaginalis or clue cells of bacterial vaginosis
KOH—Candida pseudohyphae or release of amine odor with bacterial vaginosis
B. Trichomoniasis(almost always an STD)
1. Clinical features: Women—malodorous yellow-green discharge with vulvar irritation
2. Diagnosis: Wet mount or culture. PMNs, pH >4.7, and a positive amine odor test. Sensitivity of wet
mount is 60–70%; culture is more sensitive.
3. Usual treatment: Metronidazole 2 g po as single dose
Alternative: Metronidazole 375 mg or 500 mg po bid × 7 days
Allergy to metronidazole: Desensitization (Am J Obstet Gynecol 174:934, 1996).
Topical metronidazole is not recommended.
4. Treatment failure: Repeat metronidazole 2 g/d ×3–5 days; if treatment fails again consult CDC
770-488-4115 or http://www.cdc.gov/std
5. Asymptomatic women: Treat as above
6. Pregnant women: Metronidazole 2 g ×1. Note: Treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis in pregnant
women does not reduce
P.303
preterm delivery and may do harm. Routine screening and treatment should not be done (NEJM 2001;
345:487)
7. Lactating women: Treat with 2 g metronidazole and suspend breastfeeding × 24 hr
8. Sex partners: Treat with 2 g metronidazole or 500 mg po bid × 7 days
9. Disease prevention: Patient and partner should avoid sex until both are cured
10. Treatment failures: Retreat with metronidazole 500 mg po bid × 7 days Persistent failures: 2 g dose
daily × 3–5 days
C. Bacterial vaginosis

1. Etiology: Dysbiosis of the vaginal flora with reduction in H 2 O 2 producing lactobacilli by anaerobic
bacteria, G. vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. Cause is unknown. Frequency is increased with
multiple sex partners, but rare cases are seen in virgins. Treatment of male sex partners is not
helpful.
2. Frequency: Frequency in sexually active women in STD and gynecology clinics is 5–20% ( J Obstet
Gynecol 1993;169:446.).
3. Clinical symptoms: Malodorous vaginal discharge; over half of cases are asymptomatic.
4. Diagnosis: Three of the following:
1. Homogeneous, white non-inflammatory discharge that adheres to vaginal walls
2. Presence of clue cells
3. pH of vaginal fluid >4.5
4. Fishy odor of vaginal discharge with or without addition of 10% KOH (“whiff test”)
5. Microscopic exam shows no polymorphonuclear cells, sparse lactobacclli, and numerous coccobacillary
forms on epithelial cells (clue cells). Cultures are not indicated.
6. Complications: There is an association between BV and adverse outcome of pregnancy (postpartum
endometritis, amnionitis, preterm delivery, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes) and
infectious complications of gynecologic surgery. A large trial designed to examine this issue failed to
demonstrate any benefit with metronidazole therapy (NEJM 2000;342:534.).
7. Goals of treatment:
Non-pregnant women: Relieve symptoms.
Pregnant women: Relieve symptoms and prevent adverse outcome of pregnancy (especially those with
prior preterm birth or maternal age >50).
8. Treatment
a. Non-pregnant:
Metronidazole 500 mg po bid × 7 days
Clindamycin 2% (5 g) intravaginal hs × 7 days
Metronidazole gel 0.75% (5 g) intravaginal bid × 5 days

Alternative: Metronidazole 2 g po × 1 or clindamycin 300 mg po bid × 7 days or clindamycin
ovules 100 mg intravaginally qd hs × 3 days Cure rates for preferred regimens: 75–84%
b. Pregnant: Bacterial vaginosis is associated with increased risk of preterm delivery. Some studies
show treatment is associated with reduced rates of preterm delivery (NEJM 1995;333:1732. ; Am
J Obstet Gynecol 1994;171:345.) and some do not (NEJM 2000;342:5334. ). Therefore, some
recommend screening and treatment at the first visit. Recommendations for treatment are:
P.304
Preferred: Metronidazole 250 mg po tid × 7 days
Alternatives
Metronidazole 2 g po × 1
Clindamycin 300 mg po bid × 7 days
Metronidazole gel 0.75% (5 g) intravaginal bid × 5 days
Metronidazole 250 mg po tid ×7 days
9. Sex partners: No evaluation
D. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (not considered an STD)
Includes CDC 2002 guidelines and IDSA Guidelines ( CID 2000;30:672.)
1. Clinical features: Vaginal discharge and vulvar pruritis
2. Diagnosis: Vulvovaginal erythema and white discharge. KOH wet prep or Gram stain showing yeast or
pseudohyphae, or positive culture. (Culture is non-specific) Vaginal pH is usually <4.7 and PMNs
increased. About 10–20% of healthy women harbor Candida sp in the genital tract.
3. Classification: (CID 2000;30:672.) Uncomplicated–mild to moderate severity, sporadic, C. albicans,
normal host. Complicated: Severe disease, recurrent, non-albicans species, abnormal host
(uncontrolled diabetes, immuno sup pres sion, corticosteroids, HIV, etc)
4. Treatment: Douching is contraindicated (Obstet Gynecol 1993;81:601.) Intravaginal preparation (3to 7-day regimens are usually more effective than single dose). Topical agents are oil based and may
weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Longer regimens and azoles are advocated for complicated
cases.
Topical agents

Butoconazole 2% cream (5 g)* at hs × 3 days or 2% sustained release (5%) × 1
Clotrimazole 1% cream* (5 g)* daily × 7–14 days.
Clotrimazole 100 mg vaginal tab* daily × 7 days or 2 tabs daily × 3 days or 500 mg tab × 1.
Miconazole 2% cream* (5 g) daily × 7 days.
Miconazole 200 mg supp* daily × 3 days or 100 mg supp* daily × 7 days.
Nystatin 100,000 unit vaginal tablet, one/day × 7–14 days.
Tioconazole 6.5% ointment (5 g)* × 1.
Terconazole 0.4% cream (5 g) daily × 7 days or 0.8% cream (5 g) daily × 3 days.
Terconazole 80 mg supp daily × 3 days.
Systemic agents:
Preferred: Fluconazole 150 mg po × 1
Alternatives: Itraconazole 200 mg bid × 1 day or ketoconazole 500 mg po × 5 days (CID
2000;30:672.)
Severe disease:
Topical azole × 7–14 days
Fluconazole 150 mg po and repeat at 3 days
5. Expected response rate: 70–90% within 48–72 hr. Patients may be classified as uncomplicated
vulvovaginitis (mild to moderate, sporadic, normal host, and sensitive C. albicans) vs complicated
vulvovaginitis (severe disease, abnormal host, reduced susceptibility of Candida). Uncomplicated
disease responds well to azoles including single dose and short course (7 days). Patients with
complicated vulvovaginitis often require longer therapy (10–14 days).
6. Sex partners: No evaluation
P.305
7. Pregnancy: Topical azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole, butoconazole, and terconazole) × 7 days
8. HIV serology: Not indicated for vaginal candidiasis per se.
9. Recurrent or complicated and refractory vulvovaginal candidiasis:

Topical agent × 7–14 days or fluconazole 150 mg po and repeat 3 days later ±maintenance:
Clotrimazole 500 mg topically q wk × 6 mo or itraconazole 400 mg q month or itraconazole 100 mg po
qd × 6 mo. IDSA guideline is for azole therapy po in standard dose > 2 wk, then fluconazole 150 mg q
wk, ketoconazole 100 mg qd, itraconazole 100 mg qod, or daily topical azole. Treatment of sex
partners is not effective and should not be conducted unless there is symptomatic balanitis or penile
dermatitis
10. HIV infection: Incidence of vaginal candidiasis is increased, but response to therapy isusually good.
Standard treatment should be given
XIX. Pap Smears
A. Frequency (American College of Obstetrics/Gynecology and American Cancer Society): Annually for
sexually active women
B. HIV infection: Pap smear on initial evaluation; at least one additional Pap smear should be obtained in
the next 6 mo to rule out a false-negative test. If negative, repeat testing at least annually. Results of Pap
smears should be managed similarly to those from patients without HIV infection
C. Classification of results (Bethesda System, JAMA 1989;262:931.; JAMA 1994;271:1866.):
Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL): Includes cellular changes associated with HPV and mild
dysplasia/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN 1)
High-grade SIL: Includes moderate dysplasia/CIN 2, severe dysplasia/CIN 3, and carcinoma in situ
(CIS/CIN 3)
D. Results:
Severe inflammation with reactive cellular changes: Repeat within 3 mo, then repeat every 4–6 mo
until there are three consecutive negative smears
Low-grade SIL or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS): Referral for
colposcopy; an acceptable alternative is repeat Pap smear every 4–6 mo for 2 yr until there are three
consecutive negative smears. If smears are persistently abnormal, refer for colposcopy and biopsy
High-grade SIL or persistent low-grade SIL or ASCUS: Refer to physician who can perform colposcopy
XX. Pregnancy
Hepatitis B: Screen for HBsAg (surfase antigen) at first visit
N. gonorrhoeae: Screen in first trimester; repeat in third trimester for high-risk patients

C. trachomatis: Screen in first trimester; repeat in third trimester for high-risk patients
HIV: Test with informed consent at first visit
Bacterial vaginosis: Screen with Gram stain at first visit if history of preterm delivery
Pap smear: First visit if none in prior year
Herpes simplex: Routine cultures are not indicated; see p 295
XXI. Sexual Assault
A. Evaluation
1. Initial evaluation
P.306
a. Cultures of any sites of penetration or attempted penetration for N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis (a non-culture test that is positive for C. trachomiatis must be confirmed with
another test using different technol ogy)
b. Wet mount for T. vaginalis. If vaginal discharge: Examine wet mount for bacterial vaginosis and
Candida sp
c. Serum sample for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis
Follow-up evaluation at 2 wk: Repeat evaluation
Subsequent evaluation: Serology for syphillis and HIV at 6, 12, and 24 wk
B. Treatment
Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM × 1
Metronidazole 2 g po × 1
Azithromycin 1 g po × 1 or doxycycline 100 mg po bid × 7
Hepatitis B vaccination

Footnots
*Quinolones are contraindicated in persons <17 yr, during pregnancy, and during nursing; they are ineffective vs
incubating syphilis; increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones has been reported. (Lancet 2003;262:495)

*Standard recommendations apply for disease control (abstinence from sexual intercourse until treatment
completed), partner referral, and concurrent treatment for presumed infection with C. trachomatis (doxycycline 100
mg po bid × 7 days).
*Skin test (see desensitization schedule see p 77)
*Patients with these conditions should be immediately treated, including an antibiotic for chlamydia. Sex partners
should be treated without waiting for results of tests. Chlamydia tests are encouraged even if a presumed diagnosis
is made to 1) ensure proper care, especially if symptoms persist; 2) facilitate counseling; 3) provide better grounds
for partner notification; and 4) improve compliance.
*Azithromycin has the advantage of single dose observed therapy. A comparative trial with doxycycline for PID
showed azithromycin was significantly better, presumably because of reduced compliance with tetracycline. Ofloxacin
is equally effective compared with azithromycin and doxycycline but is relatively expensive and offers no dosing
advantage. Erythromycin is less efficacious than azithromycin or doxycycline and causes substantial gastrointestinal
toxicity.
*Available over-the-counter.
